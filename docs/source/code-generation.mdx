# Run codegen as a build step

To run code generation as part of the Xcode build process, you need to create a build step that runs before "Compile Sources" to invoke a wrapper script.

The wrapper script calls through to the included binaries and files that constitute the `apollo` command-line interface. This helps ensure that you can use our tooling without having to worry about mismatched versioning between libraries.

> ðŸ“£ **Check it out:** Instead of writing the rest of this in Bash, try using our new [Swift Scripting Library](./swift-scripting), now in Beta! It supports downloading a schema and generating code.

The location of this wrapper script depends on how you've integrated Apollo into your project, but these first steps are always the same:

1. On your application target's **Build Phases** settings tab, click the **+** icon and choose **New Run Script Phase**.
2. In the created Run Script, change its name to **Generate Apollo GraphQL API**.
3. Drag this new run script just above **Compile Sources** in your list of **Build Phases** so that it executes _before_ your code is compiled.
4. Add the contents of the appropriate run script for the package manager you're using:

<a name="swift-package-manager-run-script" />
<SPMRunScriptPanel />

<a name="cocoapds-run-script" />
<PodsRunScriptPanel />

<a name="carthage-run-script" />
<CarthageRunScriptPanel />


### Troubleshooting

If you get this error:

> `Cannot find GraphQL schema file [...]`

The script can't locate your schema file. Double check the path you've used.

If you get this error:

> `No operations or fragments found to generate code for.`

You haven't defined at least one `.graphql` file with a valid operation in your build tree.

If you need to validate the structure of a GraphQL operation, you can test it against your GraphQL server using [Apollo Sandbox](https://studio.apollographql.com/sandbox).

## Advanced codegen tips and tricks

After you get up and running, here are a few improvements you can make to your codegen process.

### Prevent unnecessary recompilation

#### Set up input and output files in your build phase

If you're using a tool like Interface Builder or SwiftUI to talk to a module with its own code generation build step, this is helpful to prevent the `API.swift` file from causing an auto-regeneration loop.

For example, if you're using something like this to run your code generation for a target called `YourTarget`:

```
"${SCRIPT_PATH}"/run-bundled-codegen.sh codegen:generate --target=swift --includes=./**/*.graphql --localSchemaFile="schema.json" API.swift
```

Assuming you've set the script to run from `$(SRCROOT)/YourTarget`, you can add `$(SRCROOT)/YourTarget/**/*.graphql` (the path you're running it from + the glob you're passing to the `includes` CLI parameter) to the list of `Input Files` for your Apollo Run Script Build phase. Then, you can add `$(SRCROOT)/YourTarget/API.swift` (the path you're running it from + the output file) to the list of `Output Files`:

<img class="screenshot" src="screenshot/input_output_files.png" alt="Setting input and output files" />

This should prevent automatic rebuild cycles if none of the `InputFiles` are changed. The script *will* still run if you explicitly build and run.

There's an [open issue to auto-generate input and output file lists](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/issues/636) which will be addressed as part of Apollo iOS 1.0, but this will help until that's done.

#### Write to a temporary file

If for some reason the input/output file setup above doesn't work for you, you can also decide to first write the file to a temporary location, and then compare this temporary file to the current one. Then, only when the files differ you move the temporary file into place.

For a target called `YourTarget`, the script could look something like this:

```bash
"${SCRIPT_PATH}"/run-bundled-codegen.sh codegen:generate --target=swift --includes=./**/*.graphql --localSchemaFile="schema.json" "${SRCROOT}/YourTarget/API.swift.new"
if ! diff -q "${SRCROOT}/YourTarget/API.swift.new" "${SRCROOT}/YourTarget/API.swift"; then
  mv "${SRCROOT}/YourTarget/API.swift.new" "${SRCROOT}/YourTarget/API.swift"
else
  rm "${SRCROOT}/YourTarget/API.swift.new"
fi
```

### Generate multiple files in a folder instead of one large file

Instead of passing a single `API.swift` file, you can pass a (pre-existing) relative folder path such as `API` as the final parameter. This causes the codegen to create individual files and place them in that folder.

With small sets of `graphql` files this is usually unnecessary, but with large sets that can cause `API.swift` to be huge. Dividing it up like this can help significantly reduce compilation time.
