Welcome! This tutorial demonstrates adding the Apollo iOS SDK to an app to communicate with a GraphQL server. In this tutorial you will learn how to:

* Download a schema
* Run code generation
* Write queries and mutations
* Handle errors
* Handle Pagination
* Authenticate with a backend server
* Use subscriptions to receive real-time updates

The tutorial uses an instance of [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/) hosted on Heroku, and [Apollo Studio Sandbox](https://studio.apollographql.com/sandbox/explorer?endpoint=https%3A%2F%2Fapollo-fullstack-tutorial.herokuapp.com%2Fgraphql&_gl=1*d2b33m*_ga*MzQ1Mzc2MDg1LjE2ODE3NjA2ODc.*_ga_0BGG5V2W2K*MTY4Mjk2MjIwMi4yNS4xLjE2ODI5NjIyMzIuMC4wLjA.) which connects to that server. If you're curious about how to build your own server, see the [Apollo full-stack tutorial](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/tutorial/introduction/).

## What are you building?

This tutorial takes you through building an app to "book a seat" on any of the rockets that have been sent into space by [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/).

The tutorial is confirmed to work with the following tools:

- Xcode 14.3
- Swift 5.8
- Apollo iOS SDK 1.2.0

The tutorial assumes that you're using a Mac with Xcode and assumes some prior experience with iOS development. The tutorial is built using SwiftUI, however it is not intended to teach SwiftUI but rather to illustrate how to use the Apollo iOS SDK.

Before you start, you should either check out or download the contents of the iOS tutorial repository at [https://github.com/apollographql/iOSTutorial](https://github.com/apollographql/iOSTutorial). There's a "starter" folder where you'll begin and a "final" folder that shows what the app will wind up looking like when it's complete.
