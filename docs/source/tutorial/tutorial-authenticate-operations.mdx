title: "11. Authenticate your operations"
---

In this section you will learn how to add your login authorization token to your operations.

## Create the `AuthorizationInterceptor`

Before you can book a trip, you need to be able to pass your authentication token along to the example server. To do that, let's dig a little deeper into how iOS's `ApolloClient` works.

The `ApolloClient` uses something called a `NetworkTransport` under the hood. By default, the client creates a `RequestChainNetworkTransport` instance to handle talking over HTTP to your server.

A `RequestChain` runs your request through an array of `ApolloInterceptor` objects which can mutate the request and/or check the cache before it hits the network, and then do additional work after a response is received from the network.

The `RequestChainNetworkTransport` uses an object that conforms to the `InterceptorProvider` protocol in order to create that array of interceptors for each operation it executes. There are a couple of providers that are set up by default, which return a fairly standard array of interceptors.

The nice thing is that you can also add your own interceptors to the chain anywhere you need to perform custom actions. In this case, you want to have an interceptor that will add your token.

First, create the new interceptor. Go to **File > New > File...** and create a new **Swift File**. Name it **AuthorizationInterceptor.swift**, and make sure it's added to the **RocketReserver** target. Open that file, and add the following code:

```swift title="AuthorizationInterceptor.swift"
import Foundation
import Apollo
import ApolloAPI

class AuthorizationInterceptor: ApolloInterceptor {
    
    func interceptAsync<Operation>(
        chain: RequestChain,
        request: HTTPRequest<Operation>,
        response: HTTPResponse<Operation>?,
        completion: @escaping (Result<GraphQLResult<Operation.Data>, Error>) -> Void
    ) where Operation : GraphQLOperation {
        // TODO
    }
    
}
```

Next, import `KeychainSwift` at the top of the file so you can access the key you stored in the keychain in the last step of the tutorial:

```swift title="AuthorizationInterceptor.swift"
import KeychainSwift
```

Then, replace the `TODO` within the `interceptAsync` method with code to get the token from the keychain, and add it to your headers if it exists:

```swift title="AuthorizationInterceptor.swift"
let keychain = KeychainSwift()
if let token = keychain.get(LoginView.loginKeychainKey) {
    request.addHeader(name: "Authorization", value: token)
}

chain.proceedAsync(request: request,
                    response: response,
                    completion: completion)
```

An array of `ApolloInterceptor`s which are handed off to each request to perform in order is set up by an object conforming to the `InterceptorProvider` protocol. There's a `DefaultInterceptorProvider` which has an array with most of the Interceptors you'd want to use.

You can also make your own object conforming to `InterceptorProvider` - or, in this case, since the interceptor only needs to be added to the beginning of the list to run before all the other interceptors, you can subclass the existing `DefaultInterceptorProvider`.

Go to **File > New > File...** and create a new **Swift File**. Name it **NetworkInterceptorProvider.swift**, and make sure it's added to the **RocketReserver** target. Add code which inserts your `AuthorizationInterceptor` before the other interceptors provided by the `DefaultInterceptorProvider`:

```swift title="NetworkInterceptorProvider.swift"
import Foundation
import Apollo
import ApolloAPI

class NetworkInterceptorProvider: DefaultInterceptorProvider {
    
    override func interceptors<Operation>(for operation: Operation) -> [ApolloInterceptor] where Operation : GraphQLOperation {
        var interceptors = super.interceptors(for: operation)
        interceptors.insert(AuthorizationInterceptor(), at: 0)
        return interceptors
    }
    
}
```

> Another way to do this would be to copy and paste the list interceptors provided by the `DefaultInterceptorProvider` (which are all public), and then place your interceptors in the points in the array where you want them. However, since in this case we can run this interceptor first, it's simpler to subclass.

## Use the interceptor

Next, go back to your `Network` class. Replace the `ApolloClient` with an updated `lazy var` which creates the `RequestChainNetworkTransport` manually, using your custom interceptor provider:

```swift title="Network.swift"
class Network {
    
    static let shared = Network()
    
    private(set) lazy var apollo: ApolloClient = {
        let client = URLSessionClient()
        let cache = InMemoryNormalizedCache()
        let store = ApolloStore(cache: cache)
        let provider = NetworkInterceptorProvider(client: client, store: store)
        let url = URL(string: "https://apollo-fullstack-tutorial.herokuapp.com/graphql")!
        let transport = RequestChainNetworkTransport(interceptorProvider: provider, endpointURL: url)

        return ApolloClient(networkTransport: transport, store: store)
    }()
    
}
```

Now, go back to **AuthorizationInterceptor.swift**.
Click on the line numbers to add a breakpoint at the line where you're instantiating the `Keychain`:

```swift title="AuthorizationInterceptor.swift"
let keychain = KeychainSwift()
```

Build and run the application. Whenever a network request goes out, that breakpoint should now get hit. If you're logged in, your token will be sent to the server whenever you make a request!

Now that your operations are being authenticated, it's time to [define additional mutations](tutorial-define-additional-mutations) to be able to book and cancel trips.
