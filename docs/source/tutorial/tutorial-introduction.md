Welcome! This tutorial demonstrates adding the Apollo iOS SDK to an app to communicate with a GraphQL server. It is confirmed to work with the following tools:

- Xcode 13.2
- Swift 5.6
- Apollo iOS SDK 0.50.0

The tutorial assumes that you're using a Mac with Xcode installed. It also assumes some prior experience with iOS development.

> If you encounter any issues during the tutorial, feel free to ask questions by either [opening an issue on our GitHub repo](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/issues) or [stopping by our community forums for help](https://community.apollographql.com).

## What are you building?

This tutorial takes you through building an app to "book a seat" on any of the rockets that have been sent into space by [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/). Along the way, you'll build out functionality that uses the following features of the Apollo iOS SDK:

* Schema downloading
* Code generation
* Queries and mutations
* Error handling
* Subscriptions

A pre-built GraphQL server is provided for your app to execute operations against. 

Before you start, you should either check out or download the contents of the iOS tutorial repository at [https://github.com/apollographql/iOSTutorial](https://github.com/apollographql/iOSTutorial). There's a "starter" folder where you'll begin and a "final" folder that shows what the app will wind up looking like when it's complete.
