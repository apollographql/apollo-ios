title: Installation
---

Apollo iOS requires Xcode 8, which you can install from the [Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12).

Follow along with these steps (described in detail below) to use Apollo iOS in your app:

1. Install the Apollo framework into your project and link it to your application target
1. Install `apollo-codegen` globally through npm
1. Add a code generation build step to your target
1. Add a schema file to your target directory
1. Build your target
1. Add the generated API file to your target
1. Install the Xcode add-ons to get syntax highlighting for your `.graphql` files (optional)
1. Create `.graphql` files with your queries or mutations and add them to your target

<h2 id="installing-framework">Installing the Apollo framework</h2>

You can install `Apollo.framework` into your project using Carthage, CocoaPods, or by manually integrating it with Xcode.

### Carthage

1. Add `github "apollostack/apollo-ios"` to your Cartfile.

1. Run `carthage update`.

1. Drag and drop `Apollo.framework` from the `Carthage/Build/iOS` folder to the “Linked Frameworks and Libraries” section of your application targets’ “General” settings tab.

1. On your application targets’ “Build Phases” settings tab, click the “+” icon and choose “New Run Script Phase”. Create a Run Script in which you specify your shell (ex: `bin/sh`), add the following contents to the script area below the shell:

 ```sh
 /usr/local/bin/carthage copy-frameworks
 ```

 and add the paths to the frameworks you want to use under “Input Files”, e.g.:

 ```
 $(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/Apollo.framework
 ```
 This script works around an [App Store submission bug](http://www.openradar.me/radar?id=6409498411401216) triggered by universal binaries and ensures that necessary bitcode-related files and dSYMs are copied when archiving.

### CocoaPods

 1. Because Apollo iOS has been written using Swift 3, it requires CocoaPods 1.1.0. You can install it using:

 ```sh
 gem install cocoapods
 ```

 1. Add `pod "Apollo"` to your Podfile.

 1. Run `pod install`.

 1. Use the `.xcworkspace` file generated by CocoaPods to work on your project.

### Manual integration

You can also manually clone the [`apollo-ios` repository](https://github.com/apollostack/apollo-ios), drag `Apollo.xcodeproj` into your project or workspace, add a dependency on `Apollo.framework` to your target.

<h2 id="installing-apollo-codegen">Installing `apollo-codegen`</h2>

You will have to install the `apollo-codegen` command globally through npm:

```sh
npm install -g apollo-codegen
```

<h2 id="adding-build-step">Adding a code generation build step</h2>

In order to invoke `apollo-codegen` as part of the Xcode build process, create a build step that runs before “Compile Sources”.

1. On your application targets’ “Build Phases” settings tab, click the “+” icon and choose “New Run Script Phase”. Create a Run Script, change its name to “Generate Apollo GraphQL API” and drag it just above “Compile Sources”. Then add the following contents to the script area below the shell:

for iOS Project
```sh
APOLLO_FRAMEWORK_PATH="$(eval find $FRAMEWORK_SEARCH_PATHS -name "Apollo.framework" -maxdepth 1)"

if [ -z "$APOLLO_FRAMEWORK_PATH" ]; then
  echo "error: Couldn't find Apollo.framework in FRAMEWORK_SEARCH_PATHS; make sure to add the framework to your project."
  exit 1
fi

cd "${SRCROOT}/${TARGET_NAME}"
$APOLLO_FRAMEWORK_PATH/check-and-run-apollo-codegen.sh generate $(find . -name '*.graphql') --schema schema.json --output API.swift
```
for macOS Project
```sh
APOLLO_FRAMEWORK_PATH="$(eval find $FRAMEWORK_SEARCH_PATHS -name "Apollo.framework" -maxdepth 1)"

if [ -z "$APOLLO_FRAMEWORK_PATH" ]; then
echo "error: Couldn't find Apollo.framework in FRAMEWORK_SEARCH_PATHS; make sure to add the framework to your project."
exit 1
fi

cd "${SRCROOT}/${TARGET_NAME}"
$APOLLO_FRAMEWORK_PATH/Versions/Current/Resources/check-and-run-apollo-codegen.sh generate $(find . -name '*.graphql') --schema schema.json --output API.swift
```



The script above will invoke `apollo-codegen` through the `check-and-run-apollo-codegen.sh` wrapper script, which is actually contained in the `Apollo.framework` bundle. The main reason for this is to check whether the version of `apollo-codegen` installed on your system is compatible with the framework version installed in your project, and to warn you if it isn't. Without this check, you could end up generating code that is incompatible with the runtime code contained in the framework.

<h2 id="adding-schema">Adding a schema file to your target directory</h2>

You'll have to copy or [download a schema](downloading-schema.html) to your target directory before generating code.

Apollo iOS requires a GraphQL schema file as input to the code generation process. A schema file is a JSON file that contains the results of an an introspection query. Conventionally this file is called `schema.json`.  

<h2 id="building-target">Build your target</h2>

At this point, you can try building your target in Xcode.  This will verify that the `schema.json` file can be found by the `apollo-codegen` script created above, otherwise you'll get a build error such as:
> Cannot find GraphQL schema file [...]

<h2 id="adding-generated-api">Adding the generated API file to your target</h2>

1. Drag the generated `API.swift` file to your target.

> Note that because Apollo iOS generates query-specific result types, `API.swift` will be mostly empty at this point unless you've already added some `.graphql` files with queries or mutations to your target directory.

<h2 id="installing-xcode-add-ons">Installing the Xcode add-ons to get syntax highlighting</h2>

1. Clone the [`xcode-apollo` repository](https://github.com/apollostack/xcode-apollo) to your computer.
1. Close Xcode if it is currently running.
1. You may need to create these folders inside of `~/Library/Developer/Xcode`:

 `mkdir ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Plug-ins ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Specifications`

1. Copy `GraphQL.ideplugin` to `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Plug-ins`.

 `cp -R GraphQL.ideplugin ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Plug-ins`

1. Copy `GraphQL.xclangspec` to `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Specifications`.

 `cp -R GraphQL.xclangspec ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Specifications`

You may receive a warning when you first start up Xcode after installing these add-ons.

<h2 id="creating-query-documents">Create `.graphql` files with your queries or mutations</h2>

Apollo iOS generates code from queries and mutations contained in `.graphql` files in your target.

A useful convention is to colocate queries, mutations or fragments with the Swift code that uses them by creating `<name>.graphql` next to `<name>.swift`.

If you have the Xcode add-ons installed, you can use the Xcode companion view to show a `.swift` file and the corresponding `.graphql` file side by side.
