title: The Codegen CLI
---

The Codegen CLI provides a command line tool that streamlines the process of running code generation. The CLI can be ran manually from Terminal (or any other shell program) or can be called into from bash scripts.

The Codegen CLI has three primary functions:
- **Initialize**: Initializes an `apollo-codegen-configuration.json` file that can be used to [configure how the CLI generates code](./codegen-configuration).
- **Fetch Schema**: Fetches your GraphQL schema and writes it to a file. The schema is required in order to run code generation.
  - To learn how to configure schema fetching, see [Downloading a schema](./../downloading-schema).
- **Generate**: Runs the code generation engine using the configuration in your `apollo-codegen-configuration.json` file.

When Apollo iOS is included as a dependency through Swift Package Manager (SPM) or Cocoapods, the CLI is built and packaged with the depedency automatically. This ensures you always have a valid version of the CLI for the version of Apollo iOS you are using.

Each package manager deploys the Codegen CLI using different methods. To learn how to run the Codegen CLI with your chosen package manager, open the appropriate section:

<ExpansionPanel title="Swift Package Manager">

When using Swift Package Manager, Apollo iOS exposes the Codegen CLI as an SPM plugin. This means you can run the Codegen CLI using the `swift package` command.

After installing the Apollo iOS package, you can run the Codegen CLI from the directory of your `Package.swift` file:

```bash
swift package --allow-writing-to-package-directory ${Command Name} -${Command Arguments}
```

> **Plugin Permissions**
>
> SPM Plugins require permission to write files to your project directory. Each time you run these commands, you will be prompted to give the plugin permission. To bypass this prompt, we recommend including the `--allow-writing-to-package-directory` flag.
>
> This is a flag passed to the `swift package` command, so it must be provided *before* the name of the command.
>
> Using `--allow-writing-to-package-directory` is especially necessary when running the CLI from a non-interactive environment, such as a CI pipeline.

In SPM, each CLI command is exposed as an individual plugin. To call each command replace `${Command Name}` with the name of the command plugin you want to run:

| Command | Plugin Name |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Initialize | `apollo-initialize-codegen-config` |

---

#### Initialize

```bash
swift package --allow-writing-to-package-directory apollo-initialize-codegen-config --schema-name ${SchemaName}
```

#### Initialize the code generation configuration

The Codegen CLI uses a JSON file to configure the code generation engine. Initializing the Codegen CLI creates this file with default values. From the directory of your `Package.swift` file, run:

```bash
swift package --allow-writing-to-package-directory apollo-initialize-codegen-config --schema-name ${MySchemaName}
```

`${MySchemaName}` should be the name you would like to be used as the namespace for your generated schema files.

This will create an `apollo-codegen-config.json` file with default options.

<ExpansionPanelListItem>

#### Configure code generation options

Open the `apollo-codegen-config.json` file to configure code generation for your project.

The default configuration will:
- Find all GraphQL schema files ending with the file extension `.graphqls` within your project directory.
- Find all GraphQL operation and fragment definition files ending with the file extension `.graphql` within your project directory.
- Create a Swift Package for your generated schema with the `schema-name` provided.
- Generate operation and fragment models relative to the `.graphql` files that define them.

</ExpansionPanelListItem>

<ExpansionPanelListItem>

#### Run code generation

From the directory of your `Package.swift` file, run:

```bash
swift package --allow-writing-to-package-directory apollo-generate
```

Your generated files will be created with the file extension `.graphql.swift`.

</ExpansionPanelListItem>

<ExpansionPanelListItem>

#### Add the generated schema package to your project

A new Swift Package for your generated schema files will be located in a directory with the `schema-name` you provided. Any targets in your project that include generated operation models will need to import this package.

If your project uses a `Package.swift` file, include the schema package as a local package with this dependency:

```swift title="Package.swift"
dependencies: [
    .package(name: "MySchemaName", path: "./MySchemaName"),
],
```

For an Xcode project or workspace, go to **File > Add Packages...** and then click the `Add Local` button. Find the local package in your project directory and select it to include it in your project.

</ExpansionPanelListItem>

<ExpansionPanelListItem>

#### Add the generated operation files to your target

By default, your generated operation and fragments will be generated in the same location as the `.graphql` files they are defined by.

If your generated operations are included in paths that are defined as sources for a target in your `Package.swift` file, Xcode should automatically include your generated operations in your targets.

If your target is created in an Xcode project or workspace, you will need to manually add the generated files to your target.

> **Note:** Because adding generated files to your Xcode targets must be done manually each time you generate new files, we highly recommend defining your project targets with SPM. Alternatively, you can generate your operations into the package that includes your schema files. For more information see the documentation for [Code Generation Confiugration](./codegen-configuration).
