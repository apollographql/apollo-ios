title: Running code generation in Swift code
---

For most use cases, the Apollo iOS [Codegen CLI](./codegen-cli) is the recommended method for generating code and downloading your schema. The CLI uses the `ApolloCodegenLib` to execute these operation.

To enable advanced use, the `ApolloCodegenLib` can be included as a dependency of your own Swift projects. This enables you to use Swift scripting to perform operations that cannot be done with the CLI. Calling into the `ApolloCodegenLib` directly allows you to integrate Apollo into your development process however you would like.

## Installing `ApolloCodegenLib`

The `ApolloCodegenLib` is included as a product in the Apollo iOS SPM Package.

> At this time, `ApolloCodegenLib` only supports `macOS`. You cannot run code generation scripts on other platforms.

To use it within your own Swift project, just include it as a dependency.

```swift title="Package.swift"
.target(
    name: "MyApp",
    dependencies: [
        .product(name: "ApolloCodegenLib", package: "apollo-ios"),
    ]
)
```

> **Important:** Because code generation is tied to its usage in the Apollo iOS SDK, you make sure you are using the `ApolloCodegenLib` from the same version of the package as the application that uses your generated code.

## Usage

Once you've installed the `ApolloCodegenLib` dependency in your project, you can use it to:

- [Installing `ApolloCodegenLib`](#installing-apollocodegenlib)
- [Usage](#usage)
  - [Running code generation](#running-code-generation)
  - [Downloading a schema](#downloading-a-schema)

### Running code generation

To configure and run code generation using `ApolloCodegenLib`, create an [`ApolloCodegenConfiguration`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/docc/documentation/apollocodegenlib/apollocodegenconfiguration), then pass it to `ApolloCodegen.build(with configuration:withRootURL:)` function.

By default, the Code Generation Engine will resolve all file paths in your `ApolloCodegenConfiguration` relative to the current working directory. The `rootURL` parameter can be used to provide a local file path URL of the root of the project that you want to run code generation on. This will resolve file paths in your configuration relative to the provided `rootURL`.

```swift
import ApolloCodegenLib

let configuration = ApolloCodegenConfiguration(
    schemaName: "MySchemaName",
    input: ApolloCodegenConfiguration.FileInput(
		schemaSearchPaths: ["**/*.graphqls"],
		operationSearchPaths: ["**/*.graphql"]
	),
    output: ApolloCodegenConfiguration.FileOutput(
		schemaTypes: ApolloCodegenConfiguration.SchemaTypesFileOutput(
			path: "./generated/schema/",
			moduleType: .swiftPackageManager
        ),
		operations: .inSchemaModule,
		testMocks: .none
	),
    options: ApolloCodegenConfiguration.OutputOptions(
		additionalInflectionRules: [
			.pluralization(
				singularRegex: "animal",
				replacementRegex: "animals"
			)
		],
		queryStringLiteralFormat: .multiline,
		deprecatedEnumCases: .include,
		schemaDocumentation: .include,
		apqs: .disabled,
		cocoapodsCompatibleImportStatements: false,
		warningsOnDeprecatedUsage: .include,
		conversionStrategies: ApolloCodegenConfiguration.ConversionStrategies(
			enumCases: .camelCase
		),
		pruneGeneratedFiles: true
	)
)

try! ApolloCodegen.build(with: configuration)
```

> For more information on the configuring code generation, see the [configuration documentation](./codegen-configuration).

### Downloading a schema

If you would like to download a GraphQL schema from you own Swift project, use the [`ApolloSchemaDownloader`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/docc/documentation/apollocodegenlib/apolloschemadownloader).

The schema downloader can be configured with an [`ApolloSchemaDownloadConfiguration`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/docc/documentation/apollocodegenlib/apolloschemadownloadconfiguration).

```swift
import ApolloCodegenLib

let configuration = ApolloSchemaDownloadConfiguration(
    using: .introspection(endpointURL: endpoint, outputFormat: .SDL),
    outputPath: outputURL.path
)

try! ApolloSchemaDownloader.fetch(configuration: configuration)
```

> For more information on schema fetching, see [Downloading a schema](./downloading-schema).
