title: Creating a client
---

Before you can execute GraphQL operations in your app, you need to initialize an [`ApolloClient`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/docc/documentation/apollo/apolloclient) instance.

## Basic client creation

For a basic client with a default configuration, you can initialize [`ApolloClient`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/docc/documentation/apollo/apolloclient) just by providing the `URL` to your GraphQL server.

```swift
let client = ApolloClient(url: URL(string: "http://localhost:4000/graphql")!)
```

The default client configuration uses:
- An [`InMemoryNormalizedCache`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/docc/documentation/apollo/inmemorynormalizedcache) for [caching response data in-memory](./../caching/cache-setup#inmemorynormalizedcache).
- A [`RequestChainNetworkTransport`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/docc/documentation/apollo/requestchainnetworktransport) configured to communicate with a spec-compliant GraphQL server over HTTP.
- A [`DefaultInterceptorProvider`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/docc/documentation/apollo/defaultinterceptorprovider) that supports:
  - Reading/writing response data to the normalized cache.
  - Sending network requests using `URLSession`.
  - Parsing GraphQL response data in JSON format
  - [Automatic Persisted Queries](./../fetching/apqs).

> For more information on the in-memory normalized cache, see its documentation in [Cache Setup](./../caching/cache-setup#inmemorynormalizedcache).
>
> To learn more about the request chain or interceptor providers, check out our [Advanced networking configuration documentation](./request-pipeline).

## Custom client creation

If you need to customize your networking client configuration use the designated initializer.

[`ApolloClient`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/docc/documentation/apollo/apolloclient) is initialized with a `NetworkTransport` object and an `ApolloStore`.

```swift
public init(
  networkTransport: NetworkTransport,
  store: ApolloStore
)
```

### Network Transport

Apollo iOS provides the following classes that conform to the [`NetworkTransport` protocol](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/docc/documentation/apollo/networktransport):

| Class | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [`RequestChainNetworkTransport`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/docc/documentation/apollo/requestchainnetworktransport) | Passes a request through a chain of interceptors that can interact with the request both before and after it's transmitted. Uses standard HTTP requests to communicate with the server. |
| [`WebSocketTransport`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/docc/documentation/apollowebsocket/websockettransport) | Transmits _all_ GraphQL operations via WebSocket. Requires the `ApolloWebSocket` library. |
| [`SplitNetworkTransport`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/docc/documentation/apollowebsocket/splitnetworktransport) | Transmits subscription operations via WebSocket and other operations via HTTP. Requires the `ApolloWebSocket` library. |

> * For more information on `RequestChainNetworkTransport`, learn about [Advanced networking configuration](./request-pipeline).
>
> * For more information on `WebSocketTransport` and `SplitNetworkTransport`, see [Enabling subscription support](./../fetching/subscriptions#enabling-graphql-subscription-support).

### Apollo Store

The `ApolloStore` is the cache used for GraphQL response data. The default cache stores response data in-memory. This data is not persisted between application runs.

To persist cache data on-disk or configure the cache further, you can provide a custom `ApolloStore`.
