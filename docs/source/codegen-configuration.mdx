# Codegen Configuration Options

The ApolloCodegenConfiguration struct is how you configure the behaviour of the code generation engine. The top-level properties are:

| Property Name | Type | Description |
| ------------- | ---- | ----------- |
| `schemaName` **(required)** | `String` | Namespace used to scope the generated schema types. |
| `input` **(required)** | `FileInput` | The patterns that will be used to search for the schema and operation definition files. |
| `output` **(required)** | `FileOutput` | The location and structure of the generated files and modules. |
| `options` *(optional)* | `OutputOptions` | Rules and options to customize the generated code. |
| `experimentalFeatures` *(optional)* | `ExperimentalFeatures` | Used to enable experimental features. |
| `schemaDownloadConfiguration` *(optional)* | `ApolloSchemaDownloadConfiguration` | Configuration to fetch a GraphQL schema before generation. |

#### File input

The code generation engine requires a GraphQL schema and at least one operation to be able to generate Swift code. You can use absolute or relative paths in path matching patterns. Relative paths will be based off the current working directory.

Each path matching pattern can include the following characters:
- `*` matches everything but the directory separator (shallow), eg: `*.graphql`
- `?` matches any single character, eg: `file-?.graphql`
- `**` matches all subdirectories (deep), eg: `**/*.graphql`
- `!` excludes any match only if the pattern starts with a `!` character, eg: `!file.graphql`

The top-level properties are:

| Property Name | Type | Description |
| ------------- | ---- | ----------- |
| `schemaSearchPaths` **(required)** | `[String]` | An array of path matching pattern strings used to find GraphQL schema files. Note: JSON format schema files must have the file extension ".json". |
| `operationSearchPaths` **(required)** | `[String]` | An array of path matching pattern strings used to find GraphQL operation files. |

#### Sample JSON

If you are using the Codegen CLI JSON file, below is an example of the file input values:

```swift
TODO
```

#### File Output

The location and structure of the generated files is highly adaptable and can support a large number of different configurations. The top-level properties are:

| Property Name | Type | Description |
| ------------- | ---- | ----------- |
| `schemaTypes` **(required)** | `SchemaTypesFileOutput` | Location and structure of the generated schema types files. |
| `operations` **(required)** | `OperationsFileOutput` | Location and structure of the generated operation files such as queries, mutations, subscriptions, and fragments. |
| `testMocks` **(required)** | `TestMockFileOutput` | Location and structure of the test mock operation object files.  |
| `operationIdentifiersPath` *(optional)* | `String` | An absolute location to an operation identifier JSON map file. |

#### Sample JSON

If you are using the Codegen CLI JSON file, below is an example of the file output values:

```swift
TODO
