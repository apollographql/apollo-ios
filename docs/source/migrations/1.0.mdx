Apollo iOS 1.0 provides a stable API that uses modern Swift language conventions and features.

Among other improvements, Apollo iOS 1.0 features new:

- Code generation tooling written in pure Swift code.
- Generated models that improve readability and functionality while reducing generated code size.
- Support for using generated models in multi-module projects.
- Type-safe APIs for cache key resolution.

This article describes the significant changes for this major version of Apollo iOS and a walk-through of migrating an existing project from Apollo iOS 0.x to 1.0.

> **Steps to migrate to Apollo iOS 1.0:**
> 1. Begin by reading about the [key changes](#key-changes).
> 2. Next, follow our [step-by-step instructions](#step-by-step-instructions) to upgrade your existing app.
> 3. Finally, see [breaking changes](#breaking-changes) to resolve any remaining build errors.

## Key changes

### Generated schema module

The 0.x version of Apollo iOS generates models for your GraphQL operation definitions _and_ the input objects and enums referenced in your schema.

Apollo iOS 1.0 expands on this, generating an _entire module_ that contains models and metadata for your GraphQL schema and its type definitions.

In addition to your input objects and enum types, this module contains:
- Types for the objects, interfaces, and unions in your schema.
- Editable definitions for your custom scalars.
- An editable `SchemaConfiguration.swift` file.
- Metadata for the Apollo GraphQL executor.

Schema types are contained in their own namespace to prevent naming conflicts. You can generate this namespace as a stand-alone module, imported by your project, or as a caseless namespace enum that you can embed in your application target.

### Multi-module support

Apollo iOS 1.0 can support complex applications composed of multiple modules _or_ monolithic application targets.

The [generated schema module](#generated-schema-module) supports multi-module projects by containing all of a schema's shared types and metadata. This enables you to move generated operation models anywhere within your project structure (as long as they are linked to the schema module).

Apollo iOS's code generation engine provides flexible configuration options that make code generation work seamlessly for any project structure.

## Step-by-step instructions

> **Before migrating to Apollo iOS 1.0, you should consider your project structure and decide how you want to include your generated schema module and operation models.**
>
> To learn about how you can best integrate Apollo iOS to suit your project's needs, see our [Project configuration documentation](../project-configuration).

To migrate to Apollo iOS 1.0, you'll do the following:
1. [Update your Apollo iOS dependency](#1-update-to-apollo-ios-10)
2. [Setup code generation](#2-set-up-code-generation)
3. [Replace the code generation build phase](#3-replace-the-code-generation-build-phase)
4. [Refactor your code to use new APIs](#4-refactor-your-code)

Much of this migration process involves the new code generation mechanism.

As you go through this process, we'll explain how to remove deprecated pieces of the legacy 0.x version along the way. Each of the following steps also includes explanations for any breaking API changes.

### Step 1: Upgrade to Apollo iOS 1.0

Begin by updating your Apollo iOS dependency to the latest version. You can include Apollo iOS as a package using Swift Package Manager (SPM) or Cocoapods.

To receive bug fixes and new features, we recommend including `1.0` up to the next major release.

> To see the modules provided by the Apollo iOS SDK (and determine which modules you need), see [SDK components](../project-configuration#apollo-ios-sdk-components).

<CodeColumns cols={2}>

```swift title="Package.swift"
.package(
  url: "https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios.git",
  .upToNextMajor(from: "1.0.0")
),
```

```ruby title="Podfile"
pod 'Apollo' ~> '1.0'
```

</CodeColumns>

> **Note:** You can build Apollo iOS 1.0 as a dynamic `.xcframework` or a static library. You can also build and include Apollo iOS 1.0 as a pre-compiled binary with a build tool such as Carthage or Buck (though we don't currently document how to do this).

### Step 2: Set up code generation

Apollo iOS 1.0 includes a new code generation engine, written in pure Swift code, replacing the legacy `apollo-tooling` library. To use 1.0, you must install the new code generation engine and remove the old one.

We recommend running the new code generation engine using the Apollo Codegen CLI. You can also run code generation in a Swift script for more advanced usage.

#### Codegen CLI setup

For CLI setup instructions, select the method you are using to include `Apollo`.

<SetupCodegen />

#### Swift scripts setup

If you are [running code generation via a Swift script](./../code-generation/run-codegen-in-swift-code), update your script to use the version of `ApolloCodgenLib` that matches your `Apollo` version.

Then, update the `ApolloCodegenConfiguration` in your script with the new configuration values. For a list of configuration options, see [Codegen configuration](./../code-generation/codegen-configuration).

### Step 3: Replace the code generation build phase

> We no longer recommend running Apollo's code generation as an Xcode build phase.

Your generated files change whenever you modify your `.graphql` operation definitions (which happens infrequently). Running code generation on every build increases build times and slows development.

Instead, we recommend running code generation **manually (using the CLI)** whenever you modify your `.graphql` files.

If you want to continue running code generation on each build, you can update your build script to run the CLI `generate` command.

### Step 4: Refactor your code

While designing Apollo iOS 1.0, we tried to limit the number of code changes required to migrate from legacy versions.

Below are explanations for each [breaking change](#breaking-changes) that Apollo iOS 1.0 brings and tips on addressing those changes during your migration.

## Breaking changes

### Custom scalars

In the 0.x version of Apollo iOS, your schema's custom scalars are exposed as a `String` type field by default. If you used the `--passthroughCustomScalars` option, your generated models included the name of the custom scalar. You were responsible for defining the types passed through to your custom scalars.

In Apollo iOS 1.0, operation models use custom scalar definitions, and by default, Apollo iOS generates `typealias` definitions for all referenced custom scalars. These definitions are within your schema module. The default implementation of all custom scalars is a `typealias` to `String`.

> Custom scalar files are generated once. This means you can edit them, and subsequent code generation executions won't overwrite your changes.

To migrate a custom scalar type to Apollo iOS 1.0, do the following:
- Include the type in your schema module.
- Ensure the type conforms to the [`CustomScalarType`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/docc/documentation/apolloapi/customscalartype) protocol.
- Point the `typealias` definition to the new type.
  - Or, if the type has the exact name of your custom scalar, remove the `typealias` definition.

> For more details on defining custom scalars, see [Custom Scalars](../custom-scalars).

#### Example

We define a `scalar Coordinate`, which we reference in our GraphQL operations. Apollo iOS generates the `Coordinate` custom scalar:

```swift title="MySchema/CustomScalars/UUID.swift"
public extension MySchema {
  typealias Coordinate = String
}
```

A custom scalar with the name `Coordinate` could replace the `typealias`, like so:

```swift title="MySchema/CustomScalars/UUID.swift"
public extension MySchema {
  struct Coordinate: CustomScalarType {
    let x: Int
    let y: Int

    public init (_jsonValue value: JSONValue) throws {
      guard let value = value as? String,
        let coordinates = value.components(separatedBy: ",").compactMap({ Int($0) }),
        coordinates.count == 2 else {
        throw JSONDecodingError.couldNotConvert(value: value, to: Coordinate.self)
      }

      self.x = coordinates[0]
      self.y = coordinates[1]
    }

    public var _jsonValue: JSONValue {
      "\(x),\(y)"
    }
  }
}
```

### Cache key configuration

In the 0.x version of Apollo iOS, you could configure the computation of cache keys for the normalized cache by providing a `cacheKeyForObject` block to `ApolloClient`.

In Apollo iOS 1.0, we replace this with a type-safe API in the `SchemaConfiguration.swift` file, which Apollo iOS generates alongside the generated schema types.

To migrate your cache key configuration code, refactor your `cacheKeyForObject` implementation into the `SchemaConfiguration.swift` file's [`cacheKeyInfo(for type:object:)`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/docc/documentation/apolloapi/schemaconfiguration/cachekeyinfo(for:object:)) function. This function needs to return a `CacheKeyInfo` struct (instead of a cache key `String`).

In 0.x, we recommended that you prefix your cache keys with the `__typename` of the object to prevent key conflicts.

Apollo iOS 1.0 does this automatically. If you want to group cache keys for objects of different types (e.g., by a common interface type), you can set the `uniqueKeyGroup` property of the `CacheKeyInfo` you return.

> For more details on the new cache key configuration APIs, see [Custom cache keys](./../caching/cache-key-resolution).

#### Example

Given a `cacheKeyForObject` block:

```swift
client.cacheKeyForObject = {
  guard let typename = $0["__typename"] as? String,
    let id = $0["id"] as? String else {
      return nil
    }

  return "\(typename):\(id)"
}
```

You can migrate this to the new [`cacheKeyInfo(for type:object:)`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/docc/documentation/apolloapi/schemaconfiguration/cachekeyinfo(for:object:)) function like so:

```swift title="SchemaConfiguration.swift"
public enum SchemaConfiguration: ApolloAPI.SchemaConfiguration {
  static func cacheKeyInfo(for type: Object, object: JSONObject) -> CacheKeyInfo? {
    guard let id = object["id"] as? String else {
      return nil
    }

    return CacheKeyInfo(id: id)
  }
}
```

Or you can use the [JSON value convenience initializer](./../caching/cache-key-resolution#json-value-convenience-initializer), like so:

```swift title="SchemaConfiguration.swift"
public enum SchemaConfiguration: ApolloAPI.SchemaConfiguration {
  static func cacheKeyInfo(for type: Object, object: JSONObject) -> CacheKeyInfo? {
    return try? CacheKeyInfo(jsonValue: object["id"])
  }
}
```

### Local Cache Mutations

In the 0.x version of Apollo iOS, you could directly change data in the local cache using any of your generated operation or fragment models.

The APIs for direct cache access have mostly stayed the same but generated model objects are now **immutable by default**. You can still _read_ cache data directly using your generated models, but to mutate cache data, you now need to define separate [local cache mutation](./../caching/cache-transactions#defining-local-cache-mutations) operations or fragments.

You can define a local cache mutation model by applying the `@apollo_client_ios_localCacheMutation` directive to any GraphQL operation or fragment definition.

> For a detailed explanation of the new local cache mutation APIs, see [Direct cache access](./../caching/cache-transactions).

<SeparateLocalCacheMutationsNote />

#### Example

Given an operation and write transaction from Apollo iOS 0.x versions:

<CodeColumns>

```graphql
query UserDetails {
  loggedInUser {
    id
    name
    posts {
      id
      body
    }
  }
}
```

```swift
store.withinReadWriteTransaction({ transaction in
  let cacheMutation = UserDetailsQuery()

  let newPost = UserDetailsQuery.Data.LoggedInUser.Post(id: "789, body: "This is a new post!")

  try transaction.update(cacheMutation) { (data: inout UserDetailsQuery.Data) in
    data.loggedInUser.posts.append(newPost)
  }
})
```
</CodeColumns>

In Apollo iOS 1.0, you can rewrite this using a new `LocalCacheMutation`:

<CodeColumns>

```graphql
query AddUserPostLocalCacheMutation @apollo_client_ios_localCacheMutation {
  loggedInUser {
    posts {
      id
      body
    }
  }
}
```

```swift
store.withinReadWriteTransaction({ transaction in
  let cacheMutation = AddUserPostLocalCacheMutation()

  let newPost = AddUserPostLocalCacheMutation.Data.LoggedInUser.Post(data: DataDict(
    ["__typename": "Post", "id": "789", "body": "This is a new post!"],
    variables: nil
  ))

  try transaction.update(cacheMutation) { (data: inout AddUserPostLocalCacheMutation.Data) in
    data.loggedInUser.posts.append(newPost)
  }
})
```

</CodeColumns>

### Nullable Input Values

According to [the GraphQL spec](http://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#sec-Null-Value), explicitly providing `null` as the value for an input field is semantically different from not providing a value (`nil`).

To distinguish between `null` and `nil`, the 0.x version of Apollo iOS generated optional input values as double optional value types (`??`, or `Optional<Optional<Value>>`). This was confusing for many users and didn't clearly express the intention of the API.

In Apollo iOS 1.0, we replaced the double optional values with a new [`GraphQLNullable`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/docc/documentation/apolloapi/graphqlnullable) wrapper enum type.

This new type requires you to indicate your input fields' value or nullability behavior _explicitly_. This applies to nullable input arguments on your operation definitions and nullable properties on input objects.

While this API is slightly more verbose, it provides clarity and reduced bugs caused by unexpected behavior.

> For more examples and best practices using `GraphQLNullable`, see [Working with nullable arguments](./../fetching/operation-arguments#working-with-nullable-arguments).

#### Example

If we are passing a value to a nullable input parameter, we'll need to wrap that value in a `GraphQLNullable`:

<CodeColumns>

```swift title="Apollo iOS 0.x"
MyQuery(input: "Value")
```

```swift title="Apollo iOS 1.0"
MyQuery(input: .some("Value"))
```

</CodeColumns>

To provide a `null` or `nil` value, use `.null` or `.none`, respectively.

<CodeColumns>

```swift title="Apollo iOS 0.x"
/// A `nil` double optional value translates to omission of the value.
MyQuery(input: nil)

/// An optional containing a `nil` value translates to an `null` value.
MyQuery(input: .some(nil))
```

```swift title="Apollo iOS 1.0"
/// A `GraphQLNullable.none` value translates to omission of the value.
MyQuery(input: .none)

/// A `GraphQLNullable.null` value translates to an `null` value.
MyQuery(input: .null)
```

</CodeColumns>

When passing an optional value to a nullable input value, you need to provide a fallback value if your value is `nil`:

<CodeColumns>

```swift title="Apollo iOS 0.x"
var optionalInput: String?  = nil

MyQuery(input: optionalInput)
```

```swift title="Apollo iOS 1.0"
var optionalInput: String?  = nil

MyQuery(input: optionalInput ?? .null)
```

</CodeColumns>

### Mocking operation models for testing

In the 0.x version of Apollo iOS, you could create mocks of your generated operation models by using each model's generated initializers or by initializing them directly with JSON data. Both methods were error-prone, cumbersome, and fragile.

Apollo iOS 1.0 provides a new way to generate test mocks based on your schema types. Begin by adding [`output.testMocks`](./../code-generation/codegen-configuration#test-mocks) to your code generation configuration, then link your generated test mocks to your unit test target.

Instead of creating a model using a type's generated initializer, you create a test mock of the schema type for the underlying object. Using the test mock, you can set values for relevant fields and initialize your operation model.

Apollo iOS 1.0's new test mocks are more comprehensible and type-safe. They also remove the need for generated initializers for different model types.

Note, you can continue initializing your operation models with JSON data, but the initializer has changed slightly. For more information, [See JSON initializer](#test-mocks-from-json-data).

> For more details, see [Test Mocks](./../testing/test-mocks).

#### Examples

Given a `Hero` interface type that can be either a `Human` or `Droid` type, and the following operation definition:

```graphql
query HeroDetails {
  hero {
    id
    ... on Human {
      name
    }
    ... on Droid {
      modelNumber
    }
  }
}
```

The 0.x version of Apollo iOS generates initializers for each type on the `HeroDetails.Data.Hero` model:

```swift
struct Hero {
  static func makeHuman(id: String, name: String) {
    // ...
  }

  static func makeDroid(id: String, modelNumber: String) {
    // ...
  }
}
```

These initializers are not generated in Apollo iOS 1.0. Instead, you can initialize either a `Mock<Human>`, or a `Mock<Droid>`:

```swift
let mockHuman = Mock<Human>()
mockHuman.id = "10"
mockHuman.name = "Han Solo"

let mockDroid = Mock<Droid>()
mockDroid.id = "12"
mockDroid.modelNumber = "R2-D2"
```

Then, create mocks of the `HeroDetails.Data.Hero` model using your test mocks:

```swift
let humanHero = HeroDetails.Data.Hero(from: mockHuman)
let droidHero = HeroDetails.Data.Hero(from: mockDroid)
```

##### Test mocks from JSON Data

If you want to continue initializing your models using JSON data directly, you can update your initializers to create your model using the `init(data: DataDict)` initializer. You must also ensure that your JSON data is a `[String: AnyHashable]` dictionary.

<CodeColumns>

```swift title="0.x"
let json: [String: Any] = [
  "__typename: "Human",
  // ...
]

let hero = HeroDetails.Data.Hero(
  unsafeResultMap: json
)
```

```swift title="1.0"
let json: [String: AnyHashable] = [
  "__typename: "Human",
  // ...
]

let hero = HeroDetails.Data.Hero(
  data: DataDict(json)
)
```

</CodeColumns>
