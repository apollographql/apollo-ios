Apollo iOS 1.0 provides a stable API that uses modern Swift language conventions and features. Among other improvements, it features:

- New generated models that improve readability and functionality while reducing generated code size in most cases
- New code generation tooling that is written in pure Swift code
- Support for using generated models in multi-module projects
- Type-safe APIs for cache key resolution

Because most of the library's core concepts are unchanged, the migration to 1.0 from the legacy 0.x versions of Apollo iOS should not require serious rewrites in most cases. This page describes the most important changes, along with how to migrate an existing project from Apollo iOS 0.x to 1.0.

> **To start your migration to Apollo iOS 1.0:**
> - You should first read about the [key changes](#key-changes) highlighted below.
> - Then, follow the [step-by-step instructions](#step-by-step-instructions).
> - Lastly, use the [breaking changes](#breaking-changes) section to help you resolve any remaining build errors in your code.

## Key changes

### Generated schema module

In addition to generating models for your GraphQL operation definitions, the 0.x version generated models for the input objects and enums referenced from your schema.

Apollo iOS 1.0 expands on this, generating a whole module that contains models and metadata for your GraphQL schema and its type definitions.
In addition to your input objects and enum types, this module contains:
- Types for the objects, interfaces, and unions referenced
- Editable definitions for your custom scalars
- An editable `SchemaConfiguration.swift` file
- Metadata used by the Apollo GraphQL executor

To prevent naming conflicts with other types in your project, the schema types are contained in their own namespace.
This namespace can be generated as a stand-alone module, which can be imported by your project, or as a caseless namespace enum which can be embedded in your application target.

### Multi-module support

Apollo iOS 1.0 was designed to support complex applications composed of multiple modules as well as monolithic application targets.

To support multi-module projects, the [generated schema module](#generated-schema-module) contains all of the schema's shared types and metadata. This allows your generated operation models to be located anywhere you would like in your project structure, as long as they are linked to the schema module.

The code generation engine provides flexible configuration options that aims to make code generation work seamlessly for any project structure you prefer.


## Step-by-step instructions

> **Before performing the migration to Apollo iOS 1.0, you should consider your project structure and decide how you would like to include your generated schema module and operation models.**
>
> To learn about how you can best integrate Apollo iOS to suit your project's needs, see our [Project configuration documentation](./project-configuration).

To begin your migration to Apollo iOS 1.0 you'll need to:

- [Update your dependency to Apollo iOS version 1.0](#1-update-to-apollo-ios-10)
- [Setup code generation](#2-setup-code-generation)
- [Replace the code generation build phase](#3-replace-the-code-generation-build-phase)
- [Refactor your code to use the new APIs](#4-refactor-your-code)

Much of the migration process involves the new code generation mechanism, which is detailed in this step-by-step guide. It will walk you through this process, explaining how to remove deprecated pieces of the legacy 0.x version along the way.

Below the step-by-step instructions, you will find explanations of each breaking API change in Apollo iOS 1.0.

### 1. Update to Apollo iOS 1.0

The first step in the migration is to update your dependency to the latest version. Apollo iOS can be included as a package using Swift Package Manager (SPM) or Cocoapods.

In order to receive bug fixes and new features, we recommend including `1.0` up to the next major release.

> To see what modules are provided by the Apollo iOS SDK and determine which modules you need to include in your project, see our [SDK components documentation](./project-configuration#apollo-ios-sdk-components).

<CodeColumns cols={2}>

```swift title="Package.swift"
.package(
  url: "https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios.git",
  .upToNextMajor(from: "1.0.0")
),
```

```ruby title="Podfile"
pod 'Apollo' ~> '1.0'
```

</CodeColumns>

> **Note:** Apollo iOS 1.0 supports being built as a dynamic `.xcframework` or as a static library. While our documentation does not provide step-by-step instructions on this process, building and including Apollo iOS 1.0 as a pre-compiled binary with a build tool such as Carthage or Buck is possible.

### 2. Setup code generation

Apollo iOS 1.0 includes a new code generation engine, written in 100% Swift code, to replace the legacy `apollo-tooling` code generation. To use 1.0, you will need to install the new code generation engine and remove the old engine.

The recommended way to use the new code generation engine is through the Apollo Codegen CLI. For advanced usage, you can run code generation in a Swift script.

#### Codegen CLI setup

For CLI setup instructions, select the method you are using to include `Apollo`.

<SetupCodegen />

#### Swift scripts setup

If you are [running code generation using a Swift script](./../code-generation/run-codegen-in-swift-code), update your swift script to use the version of `ApolloCodgenLib` matching your `Apollo` version.

Then, update your `ApolloCodegenConfiguration` in your script with the new configuration values. All configuration options can be found in the [Codegen configuration documentation](./../code-generation/codegen-configuration).

### 3. Replace the code generation build phase

Running Apollo's code generation as an Xcode build phase is no longer recommended. Generated files only change when you modify your `.graphql` operation definitions, which usually happens infrequently. Running code generation on every build causes increased build times and a slower development process. Instead, we recommend that you run code generation manually using the CLI when you modify your `graphql` files.

If you would like to continue running code generation on each build, you can update your build script to run the CLI `generate` command.

### 4. Refactor your code

Apollo iOS 1.0 was designed to make the migration require as few changes to your code as possible, however there are a number of breaking changes that will require you to refactor some of your code.

Below you will find explanations of each of the breaking API changes and tips on how to address them while migrating to 1.0.

## Breaking changes

### Custom scalars

The way we handle the definitions for custom scalars has changed in 1.0. If you have defined any custom scalar types or used the `--passthroughCustomScalars` code generation option, you will need to migrate your custom scalars.

In the 0.x version of Apollo iOS, custom scalars in your schema were exposed as a `String` type fields by default. If you used the `--passthroughCustomScalars` option, the name of the custom scalar would be used in your generated models. You were responsible for for defining types for passed through custom scalars.

In 1.0, operation models always use the custom scalar definitions and default `typealias` definitions are generated for all of your referenced custom scalars. These custom scalar definitions are located in your schema module.
The default implementation of all custom scalars is a `typealias` to `String`.

The generated custom scalar definition files can be edited, and your changes will not be overwritten when code is generated in the future. To migrate a custom scalar type to 1.0:
- Include the type in your schema module
- Make the type conform to the [`CustomScalarType`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/docc/documentation/apolloapi/customscalartype) protocol
- Change the `typealias` to point to the new type
  - Or if the type has the exact name of your custom scalar, remove the `typealias`

> For a detailed explanation on defining custom scalars, read the [custom scalars documentation](./../fetching/../custom-scalars).

#### Example

Given a schema defining `scalar Coordinate` that is referenced in your GraphQL operations, the `Coordinate` custom scalar will be generated:

```swift title="MySchema/CustomScalars/UUID.swift"
public extension MySchema {
  typealias Coordinate = String
}
```

A custom scalar with the name `Coordinate` could replace the `typealias` like so:

```swift title="MySchema/CustomScalars/UUID.swift"
public extension MySchema {
  struct Coordinate: CustomScalarType {
    let x: Int
    let y: Int

    public init (_jsonValue value: JSONValue) throws {
      guard let value = value as? String,
        let coordinates = value.components(separatedBy: ",").compactMap({ Int($0) }),
        coordinates.count == 2 else {
        throw JSONDecodingError.couldNotConvert(value: value, to: Coordinate.self)
      }

      self.x = coordinates[0]
      self.y = coordinates[1]
    }

    public var _jsonValue: JSONValue {
      "\(x),\(y)"
    }
  }
}
```

### Cache key configuration

In the 0.x version of Apollo iOS, you could configure the computation of cache keys for the normalized cache by providing a `cacheKeyForObject` block to the `ApolloClient`. In 1.0, this is replaced by a type-safe API in the `SchemaConfiguration.swift` file that is generated alongside your generated schema types.

To migrate your cache key configuration code, refactor your `cacheKeyForObject` implementation into the `SchemaConfiguration.swift` file's [`cacheKeyInfo(for type:object:)`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/docc/documentation/apolloapi/schemaconfiguration/cachekeyinfo(for:object:)) function. In this function you will return a `CacheKeyInfo` struct, rather than a cache key `String`.

In 0.x, it was recommended that you prefix your cache keys with the `__typename` of the object to prevent key conflicts. In 1.0, this is done automatically for you. If you want to group cache keys for objects of different types together (by a common interface type, for example), you can set the `uniqueKeyGroup` property of the `CacheKeyInfo` you return.

> For a detailed explanation of the new cache key configuration APIs, read the [cache key resolution documentation](./../caching/cache-key-resolution).

#### Example

Given a `cacheKeyForObject` block:

```swift
client.cacheKeyForObject = {
  guard let typename = $0["__typename"] as? String,
    let id = $0["id"] as? String else {
      return nil
    }

  return "\(typename):\(id)"
}
```

You can migrate this to the new [`cacheKeyInfo(for type:object:)`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/docc/documentation/apolloapi/schemaconfiguration/cachekeyinfo(for:object:)) function like so:

```swift
public extension MySchema {
  static func cacheKeyInfo(for type: Object, object: JSONObject) -> CacheKeyInfo? {
    guard let id = object["id"] as? String else {
      return nil
    }

    return CacheKeyInfo(id: id)
  }
}
```

Or using the [JSON value convenience initializer](./../caching/cache-key-resolution#json-value-convenience-initializer) like so:

```swift
public extension MySchema {
  static func cacheKeyInfo(for type: Object, object: JSONObject) -> CacheKeyInfo? {
    return try? CacheKeyInfo(jsonValue: object["id"])
  }
}
```

### Local Cache Mutations

In the 0.x version, you could directly make changes to data in the local cache using any of your generated operation or fragment models. While the APIs for direct cache access have not change significantly, the generated model objects are now immutable by default. You can still read cache data directly using all of your generated models, but in order to mutate cache data, you will now need to define seperate [local cache mutation](./../caching/cache-transactions#defining-local-cache-mutations) operations or fragments.

You can define a local cache mutation model by applying the `@apollo_client_ios_localCacheMutation` directive to any GraphQL operation or fragment definition.

> For a detailed explanation of the new local cache mutation APIs, read the [direct cache access documentation](./../caching/cache-transactions).

<SeperateLocalCacheMutationsNote />

#### Example

Given this operation and from the 0.x version and a write transaction to update the local cache:

<CodeColumns>

```graphql
query UserDetails {
  user {
    id
    name
    posts {
      id
      body
    }
  }
}
```

```swift
store.withinReadWriteTransaction({ transaction in
  let cacheMutation = UserDetailsQuery()

  let newPost = UserDetailsQuery.Data.Posts(id: "789, body: "This is a new post!")

  try transaction.update(cacheMutation) { (data: inout UserDetailsQuery.Data) in
    data.user.posts.append(newPost)
  }
})
```
</CodeColumns>

### Nullable Input Values

According to [the GraphQL spec](http://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#sec-Null-Value), explicitly providing a `null` value for an input value to a field argument is semantically different from not providing a value at all (`nil`). This enum allows you to distinguish your input values between `null` and `nil`.

In order to distinguish between `null` and `nil` the 0.x version generated optional input values as double optional value types (`??`, or `Optional<Optional<Value>>`). This caused confusion for many users and did not express the intention of the APIs clearly. In 1.0, we have replaced the use of double optional values with a new [`GraphQLNullable`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/docc/documentation/apolloapi/graphqlnullable) wrapper enum type.

This new type requires you to explicitly indicate the value or nullability behavior of your input values. This applies to nullable input arguments on your operation definitions and nullable properties on input objects. While this API is slightly more verbose, it provides more clarity and requires you to explicitly express your intent for handling nullable values. This provides you with more expressive and reduced bugs caused by unexpected behavior.

> For a more examples and best practices using `GraphQLNullable`, read the [working with nullable arguments documentation](./../fetching/operation-arguments#working-with-nullable-arguments).

#### Example

When passing a value to a nullable input parameter, you will need to wrap the value in a `GraphQLNullable`.

<CodeColumns>

```swift title="0.x"
MyQuery(input: "Value")
```

```swift title="1.0"
MyQuery(input: .some("Value"))
```

</CodeColumns>

To provide a `null` or `nil` value, use `.null`, or `.none` respectively.

<CodeColumns>

```swift title="0.x"
/// A `nil` double optional value translates to omission of the value.
MyQuery(input: nil)

/// An optional containing a `nil` value translates to an `null` value.
MyQuery(input: .some(nil))
```

```swift title="1.0"
/// A `GraphQLNullable.none` value translates to omission of the value.
MyQuery(input: .none)

/// A `GraphQLNullable.null` value translates to an `null` value.
MyQuery(input: .null)
```

</CodeColumns>

When passing an optional value to a nullable input value, you will now need to explicitly provide the fallback value if your value is `nil`.

<CodeColumns>

```swift title="0.x"
var optionalInput: String?  = nil

MyQuery(input: optionalInput)
```

```swift title="1.0"
var optionalInput: String?  = nil

MyQuery(input: optionalInput ?? .null)
```

</CodeColumns>

### Mocking operation models for testing

In the 0.x version, you could use the create mocks of your generated operation models by using the generated initializers on your models or initialize them directly with JSON data. Both methods were error-prone, cumbersome, and fragile.

Apollo iOS 1.0 provides new functionality for generated test mocks based on your schema types. These test mocks make creating mocks of your operation models more readable and type-safe. This also removes the need for the large number of generated initializers for different models types.

To generate test mocks, add the [`output.testMocks`](./../code-generation/codegen-configuration#test-mocks) value to your code generation configuration, then link your generated test mocks to your unit test target.

Instead of creating a model using the generated initializer for a type, create a test mock of the schema type for the underlying object, set values for the relevant fields, and then initialize your operation model using the test mock. If you would like to continue to initialize your operation models with JSON data, this is still possible, but the initializer has changed slightly. See the [JSON initializer example](#test-mocks-from-json-data) below for more information.

> For more details on generating and using test mocks, read our [test mocks documentation](./../testing/test-mocks).

#### Examples

Given a `Hero` interface type that can be either a `Human` or `Droid` type and the following operation definition:

```graphql
query HeroDetails {
  hero {
    id
    ... on Human {
      name
    }
    ... on Droid {
      modelNumber
    }
  }
}
```

The 0.x version would generated initializers for each type on the `HeroDetails.Data.Hero` model:

```swift
struct Hero {
  static func makeHuman(id: String, name: String) {
    // ...
  }

  static func makeDroid(id: String, modelNumber: String) {
    // ...
  }
}
```

These initializers are not generated in 1.0. Instead, initialize either a `Mock<Human>`, or a `Mock<Droid>`:

```swift
let mockHuman = Mock<Human>()
mockHuman.id = "10"
mockHuman.name = "Han Solo"

let mockDroid = Mock<Droid>()
mockDroid.id = "12"
mockDroid.modelNumber = "R2-D2"
```

Then, create mocks of the `HeroDetails.Data.Hero` model using your test mocks:

```swift
let humanHero = HeroDetails.Data.Hero(from: mockHuman)
let droidHero = HeroDetails.Data.Hero(from: mockDroid)
```

##### Test mocks from JSON Data

If you want to continue to initalize your models using JSON data directly, change your initializers to initialize your model using the `init(data: DataDict)` initalizer. You will also need to ensure that your JSON data is a `[String: AnyHashable]` dictionary.

<CodeColumns>

```swift title="0.x"
let json: [String: Any] = [
  "__typename: "Human",
  // ...
]

let hero = HeroDetails.Data.Hero(
  unsafeResultMap: json
)
```

```swift title="1.0"
let json: [String: AnyHashable] = [
  "__typename: "Human",
  // ...
]

let hero = HeroDetails.Data.Hero(
  data: DataDict(json)
)
```

</CodeColumns>
