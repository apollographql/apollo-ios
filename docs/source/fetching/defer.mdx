title: Using the @defer directive in Apollo iOS
---

> ⚠️ **The `@defer` directive is currently [experimental](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/resources/release-stages/#experimental-features) in Apollo iOS and is available for use in the `TBD` release.** If you have feedback on the feature, please let us know via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug%2Cneeds+investigation&projects=&template=bug_report.yaml).

Beginning with version `TBD`, Apollo iOS provides experimental support of [the `@defer` directive](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/rfcs/DeferStream.md), which enables your queries to receive data for specific fields asynchronously. This is helpful whenever some fields in a query take much longer to resolve than the others.

For example, let's say we're building a social media application that can quickly fetch a user's basic profile information, but retrieving that user's friends takes longer. If we include _all_ of those fields in a single query, we want to be able to display the profile information as soon as it's available, instead of waiting for the friend fields to resolve.

To achieve this, we can apply the `@defer` directive to an in-line fragment that contains all slow-resolving fields related to friend data:

```graphql
query PersonQuery($personId: ID!) {
  person(id: $personId) {
    # Basic fields (fast)
    id
    firstName
    lastName

    # highlight-start
    # Friend fields (slower)
    ... on User @defer {
      friends {
        id
      }
    }
    # highlight-end
  }
}
```

In the generated code for this query, the `asUser` field for the fragment will be optional. That is because when the initial payload is received from the server, the fields of the fragment are not yet present. A `Person` will be returned with only the basic fields filled in.

When the fields of the fragment are available, a new `Person` will be returned, this time with the `asUser` field present and filled with the fields of the fragment.

```swift
client.fetch(query: ExampleQuery()) { result in
  switch (result) {
  case let .success(data):
    if let item = data.data?.person.asUser {
      print("Query Success! Received all fields")
    } else {
      print("Query Success! Received basic fields")
    }
  case let .failure(error):
    print("Query Failure! \(error)")
  }
}
```

Will print something like this:

```
Query Success! Received basic fields
Query Success! Received all fields
```
