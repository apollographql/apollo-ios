title: Error Handling
---

Whenever you execute a GraphQL operation with two high-level types of errors can occur:

- **Network errors**: a GraphQL response wasn't received because an error occurred while communicating with your GraphQL server. This might be an SSL error, a socket error because your app is offline, or a 500 or any other HTTP error. When a network error occurs, no data is returned.
- **GraphQL errors**: a GraphQL response is received, and it contains a non-empty [`errors`](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-Errors) field. This means the server wasn't able to completely process the query. The response might include partial data if the server was able to process some of the query.

## Network errors

The result of executing an operation is a Swift [`Result`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/result). A network error results in a `.failure(Error)` result for the operation.

You can handle network errors by using a `do/catch` block and calling `try result.get()` or by switching on the `result`.

```swift
apollo.fetch(query: HeroNameQuery()) { result in
  do {
    let data = try result.get().data
    ...

  } catch {
    // Network error
    print(error)
  }
}
```

```swift
apollo.fetch(query: HeroNameQuery()) { result in
  switch result {
  case .success(let response):
    ...

  case .failure(let error):
    // Network error
    print(error)
  }
}
```

</CodeColumns>

### Causes

Possible causes of a network error include (but are not limited to):

* The app is offline or doesn't have access to the network.
* A DNS error occurred, making it impossible to look up the host.
* An SSL error occurred (e.g., the server certificate isn't trusted).
* The connection was closed.
* The server responded with a non-successful HTTP code.
* The server didn't respond with valid JSON.
* The response JSON doesn't satisfy the schema and cannot be parsed.
* A request was specified as `.returnCacheDataDontFetch` but the data wasn't cached.

Examine the exception for more detailed information about the actual error.

## GraphQL errors

Because a response with GraphQL errors might still contain data, a `.failure` result is not returned. Instead, they return a `.success` result containing a [`GraphQLResult`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/docc/documentation/apollo/graphqlresult) whose `errors` field contains the errors that occurred.

For example, the following query uses an invalid `id` to look up a `Person`:

```graphql
query FilmAndPersonQuery {
  film(id: "ZmlsbXM6M") {
    title
  }
  person(id: "badId") {
    name
  }
}
```

The server will send the following response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "film": {
      "title": "A New Hope"
    },
    "person": null
  },
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "No entry in local cache for https://swapi.dev/api/people/mï¿½H/",
      "locations": [
        {
          "line": 35,
          "column": 3
        }
      ],
      "path": [
        "person"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that while there are errors, the query successfully returned the title of the film: `A New Hope`. In general, any error while executing an operation [bubbles up](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-Errors) to the next nullable field. In this case `data?.person` is `nil`. In the worst case, `GraphQLResult.data` may be `nil` if everything else is non-nullable.

Apollo iOS gives you access to both the `data` and the `errors` in the [`GraphQLResult`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/docc/documentation/apollo/graphqlresult) class:

```swift
apollo.fetch(query: HeroNameQuery()) { result in
  switch result {
  case .success(let response):
    if let errors = response.errors {
      // GraphQL errors
    }

    let film = response.data?.film // Exists
    let person = response.data?.person // nil

  case .failure(let error):
    // Network error
    print(error)
  }
}
```

GraphQL errors are returned as type-safe [`GraphQLError`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/docc/documentation/apollo/graphqlerror) values. These values are parsed from the response as described in the section on [response format errors in the GraphQL specification](https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#sec-Errors).
