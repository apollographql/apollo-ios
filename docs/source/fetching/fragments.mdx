title: Fragments
---

The GraphQL spec defines two types of [fragments](http://graphql.org/learn/queries/#fragments):
- [Named fragments](#named-fragments), which enable you to reuse a set of fields across multiple operations or selection sets.
- [Inline fragments](#inline-fragments), which can group fields and apply type conditions or directives but are *not* reusable.

Both named and inline fragments can be used as [type conditions](./type-conditions), which enables you to access fields of [polymorphic types](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/schema/unions-interfaces/).

> Read the [guide on type conditions](./type-conditions) to learn more.

## Named fragments

A named fragment is defined in a `.graphql` file, just like an operation definition. A named fragment always has a name and a "parent type", that is, the type in the schema that it can be applied to. This fragment can be included in a selection set in an operation definition.

Apollo iOS generates separate result types for named fragments, which means they are a great way of keeping UI components or utility functions independent of specific queries.

<CodeColumns cols={2}>

```graphql title="HeroDetailsFragment.graphql"
fragment HeroDetails on Character {
  name
  appearsIn
}
```

```graphql title="HeroAndFriendsQuery.graphql"
query HeroAndFriends {
  hero {
    name
    ...HeroDetails
    friends {
      ...HeroDetails
    }
  }
}
```

</CodeColumns>

Apollo iOS generates a type-safe model for the `HeroDetails` fragment that looks something like this (details are omitted to focus on the class structure):

```swift title="HeroDetails.graphql.swift"
struct HeroDetails: MySchema.SelectionSet, Fragment {
  let name: String
  let appearsIn: [Episode]
}
```

The result data models generated for the `HeroAndFriendsQuery` will include the fields from the `HeroDetails` fragment and are able to be converted into the `HeroDetails` fragment model.

```swift title="HeroAndFriendsQuery.graphql.swift"
class HeroAndFriendsQuery: GraphQLQuery {
  struct Data: SelectionSet {
    let hero: Hero

    struct Hero: SelectionSet {
      let name: String
      let friends: [Friend]
      let appearsIn: [Episode]

      // Fragment Conversion Declaration
      var fragments: Fragments
      struct Fragments {
        var heroDetails: HeroDetails { ... }
      }

      struct Friend: SelectionSet {
        let name: String
        let appearsIn: [Episode]

        // Fragment Conversion Declaration
        var fragments: Fragments
        struct Fragments {
          var heroDetails: HeroDetails { ... }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Fragment conversion

A result model that includes a fragment in it's definition will contain a `Fragments` struct that facilitates fragment conversion.

Both the `Hero` and the `Friend` models from the `HeroAndFriendsQuery` above have a `Fragments` struct and can be converted to the `HeroDetails` fragment.

```swift
let hero: HeroDetails = data.hero.fragments.heroDetails
let friends: [HeroDetails] = data.hero.friends.map { $0.fragments.heroDetails }
```

### Fragment reuse

Fragment conversion allows you to reuse fragments as common models across different operations or multiple objects within the same operation.

One common pattern is to define a fragment for a child view, and include the fragment in a query defined at a parent level. This way, the child view can easily be reused and only depends on the specific data it needs.

The `HeroDetails` fragment above is used for both the `Hero` and `Friend` models from the `HeroAndFriendsQuery`, but a hero can be displayed alongside their friends in your application by showing a list of views that each are configured with a `HeroDetails` fragment model.

```swift title="HeroDetailsView.swift"
struct HeroDetailsListView: View {
  let data: HeroAndFriendsQuery.Data

  var body: some View {
    VStack {
      HeroDetailsView(hero: data.hero.fragments.heroDetails)
      for friend in data.hero.friends {
        HeroDetailsView(hero: friend.fragments.heroDetails)
      }
    }
  }
}

struct HeroDetailsView: View {
  let hero: HeroDetails

  var body: some View {
    HStack {
      Text(hero.name)
      Text(hero.appearsIn.description)
    }
  }
}
```

You can add additional data to the `HeroDetails` fragment and display that data in the `HeroDetailsView` without affecting the parent view at all. Additionally, the `HeroDetailsView` can be used with other GraphQL operations that include the `HeroDetails` fragment.

## Inline fragments

An [inline fragment](http://graphql.org/learn/queries/#inline-fragments) is a fragment that has no name. It is declared "inline" within another definition and cannot be reused. Inline fragments can be included in an operation definition, a named fragment definition, or nested inside another inline fragment. They are typically used to conditionally include fields in an operation using a [type conditions](./type-conditions) or the `@skip`/`@include` directives.

Apollo iOS does not generate individual models for inline fragments, instead they affect the generated models for the operations or fragments containing them.

You can use inline fragments with type conditions to query for type-specific fields:

```graphql
query HeroAndFriends($episode: Episode) {
  hero(episode: $episode) {
    name
    ... on Droid {
      primaryFunction
    }
  }
}
```

And results from inline fragments with type conditions will be made available through specially generated `as<Type>` properties:

```swift
let name: String = data.hero.name
let primaryFunction: String = data.hero.asDroid?.primaryFunction
```
