title: Type Conditions
---

The GraphQL type system includes interfaces and unions as abstract types that object types can conform to. A field in a GraphQL schema with an abstract return type may return any concrete `type` that can be converted to the abstract type.

Consider the following schema:

```graphql title="StarWarsSchema.graphqls"
type Query {
    hero: Character!
}

interface Character {
    name: String!
}

type Human implements Character {
    name: String!
}

type Droid implements Character {
    name: String!
    primaryFunction: String!
}
```

Since both the `Human` and `Droid` types implement the `Character` interface, they can both be converted into the abstract type `Character`. That means the result of a field of the `Character` type (ie. `hero`), the can be either a `Human` or a `Droid`. When we query the `hero` field, the server doesn't return a response object of the `Character` type, it returns either a concrete type that implements the `Character` interface. In this case, that is either a `Human` or a `Droid`.

## Type conversion

In order to know if the type of an object in a response can be converted to another type, we have to know the concrete type of the object. We can request that the server provides us the concrete type of the object by fetching the [`__typename` metadata field](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-Type-Name-Introspection).

Apollo iOS automatically augments your queries to add the `__typename` field to every object in your operations. This is  primarily to support conditional type conversion, but it means a `__typename` property is always defined and can be used to differentiate between object types manually if needed.

An object can be converted to an another type based on the following rules, where the "target type" is the type that we are attempting to convert *to*:
- If the target type is a concrete **object type**:
  - If the object's type is exactly the target type.
- If the target type is an **interface**:
  - If the object's type implements the target interface type.
- If the target type is a **union**:
  - If the target union type's set of possible types includes the object's type.

## Querying with type conditions

Whenever we want to query type-specific fields on an object with an abstract type, we have to use a type condition.

In this example, we want to query the `primaryFunction` on the `hero` field, but we can only query the `primaryFunction` field if the returned `hero` is a `Droid` type. The following query definition is invalid and does not compile:

```graphql title="HeroAsDroidQuery.graphql"
query HeroAsDroid {
  hero {
    name
    primaryFunction // Field "primaryFunction" does not exist on type "Character"
  }
}
```

We can query the `primaryFunction` field using a fragment on the `Droid` type. This can be either a [named fragment](./fragments#named-fragments) or an [inline fragment](./fragments#inline-fragments).

<CodeColumns cols={2}>

```graphql title="Inline Fragment"
query HeroAsDroid {
  hero {
    name
    ... on Droid {
      primaryFunction
    }
  }
}
```

```graphql title="Named Fragment"
query HeroAsDroid {
  hero {
    name
    ...DroidDetails
  }
}

fragment DroidDetails on Droid {
  name
  primaryFunction
}
```

</CodeColumns>

## Accessing conditional response data

Using a fragment on another type creates a type condition in the generated model objects.

In order to access the `primaryFunction` on the `Hero` model, we need to know if the hero is a droid. Apollo iOS will generate a `Hero` model with an optional `asDroid` property:

```swift title="HeroAsDroidQuery.graphql.swift"
class HeroAsDroidQuery: GraphQLQuery {
  struct Data: SelectionSet {
    let hero: Hero

    struct Hero: SelectionSet {
      let name: String
      var asDroid: AsDroid? { ... }

      // Type Condition Declaration
      struct AsDroid: InlineFragment {
        let name: String
        let primaryFunction: String
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `hero.asDroid` property is optional, and will only return a value if the type of the hero object in the response data is a droid. We can now conditionally convert the `Hero` to an `AsDroid` model and access the `primaryFunction` property.

```swift
let primaryFunction: String? = hero.asDroid?.primaryFunction
```

### Converting to a conditional named fragment

If the type condition is created by a named fragment, the `asDroid` object can also be used to perform [fragment conversion](./fragments#fragment-conversion).

Here we declare the type condition with a fragment named `DroidDetails`:

<CodeColumns cols={2}>

```graphql title="Query & Fragment Definitions"
query HeroAsDroid {
  hero {
    name
    ...DroidDetails
  }
}

fragment DroidDetails on Droid {
  name
  primaryFunction
}
```

```swift title="Generated Model"
class HeroAsDroidQuery: GraphQLQuery {
  struct Data: SelectionSet {
    let hero: Hero

    struct Hero: SelectionSet {
      let name: String

      var asDroid: AsDroid? { ... }

      // Type Condition Declaration
      struct AsDroid: InlineFragment {
        let name: String
        let primaryFunction: String

        // Fragment Conversion Declaration
        var fragments: Fragments
        struct Fragments {
          var droidDetails: DroidDetails { ... }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</CodeColumns>

In order to convert the `Hero` into a `DroidDetails` fragment, we need to know if the hero is a droid. With a named fragment, Apollo iOS generates a `Hero.AsDroid` model that includes a conversion to `DroidDetails`. We can now convert to an optional `DroidDetails` fragment.

```swift
let droidDetails: DroidDetails? = hero.asDroid?.fragments.droidDetails
```
