title: Subscriptions
---

Subscriptions are long-lived GraphQL read operations that can update their response over time, enabling clients to receive new data as it becomes available.

Apollo iOS supports subscriptions over the following protocols:

- [WebSocket](#websocket), including multiple [subprotocols](#websocket-subprotocols)
- [HTTP](#http), using [chunked multipart responses](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-over-http/blob/main/rfcs/IncrementalDelivery.md) (version 1.1.0 and later)

**You must use whichever protocol is supported by your GraphQL endpoint.**

## Enabling support

To support GraphQL subscriptions, you need to initialize your `ApolloClient` instance with a [`NetworkTransport`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/docc/documentation/apollo/networktransport) that supports subscriptions. See below for applicable classes for each subscription protocol.

### WebSocket

To use Apollo iOS with WebSocket-based subscriptions, you need to install the optional  `ApolloWebSocket` library. This library includes two classes that conform to the [`NetworkTransport` protocol](../docc/documentation/apollo/networktransport):

- **[`WebSocketTransport`](../docc/documentation/apollowebsocket/websockettransport)** sends _all_ operations (including queries and mutations) over WebSocket.
- **[`SplitNetworkTransport`](../docc/documentation/apollowebsocket/splitnetworktransport)** maintains a [`WebSocketTransport`](../docc/documentation/apollowebsocket/websockettransport) instance, _along with_ an [`UploadingNetworkTransport`](../docc/documentation/apollo/uploadingnetworktransport) instance (usually [`RequestChainNetworkTransport`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/docc/documentation/apollo/requestchainnetworktransport)). This provides a single network transport that uses HTTP for queries and mutations and WebSocket for subscriptions.

`SplitNetworkTransport` is recommended for most use cases, because it enables you to retain a single `NetworkTransport` setup that avoids issues caused by using multiple client objects.

Here's an example of setting up an `ApolloClient` that uses a `SplitNetworkTransport` to support all operation types:

<ExpansionPanel title="Click to expand">

```swift
/// A common store to use for `httpTransport` and `webSocketTransport`.
let store = ApolloStore()

/// A web socket transport to use for subscriptions
let webSocketTransport: WebSocketTransport = {
  let url = URL(string: "ws://localhost:8080/websocket")!
  let webSocketClient = WebSocket(url: url, protocol: .graphql_transport_ws)
  return WebSocketTransport(websocket: webSocketClient)
}()

/// An HTTP transport to use for queries and mutations
let httpTransport: RequestChainNetworkTransport = {
  let url = URL(string: "http://localhost:8080/graphql")!
  return RequestChainNetworkTransport(interceptorProvider: DefaultInterceptorProvider(store: store), endpointURL: url)
}()

/// A split network transport to allow the use of both of the above
/// transports through a single `NetworkTransport` instance.
let splitNetworkTransport = SplitNetworkTransport(
  uploadingNetworkTransport: httpTransport,
  webSocketNetworkTransport: webSocketTransport
)

/// Create a client using the `SplitNetworkTransport`.
let client = ApolloClient(networkTransport: splitNetworkTransport, store: store)
```

#### WebSocket subprotocols

Apollo iOS supports the following WebSocket subprotocols for subscriptions:

- [`graphql-ws`](https://github.com/apollographql/subscriptions-transport-ws/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md), which is implemented in the [subscriptions-transport-ws](https://github.com/apollographql/subscriptions-transport-ws) and [AWS AppSync](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/real-time-websocket-client.html#handshake-details-to-establish-the-websocket-connection) libraries. (⚠️ This protocol is not actively maintained!)
- [`graphql-transport-ws`](https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md), which is implemented in the [graphql-ws](https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws) library.

> **Note:** These protocols are **not** cross-compatible. You need to use whichever protocol is supported by your GraphQL endpoint. All `WebSocket` initializers enable you to specify which protocol to use (expand the code block above for an example).

#### Providing authorization tokens

In a standard HTTP operation, if authentication is necessary an `Authorization` header is often sent with requests. However, with WebSocket, this can't be sent with every payload because a persistent connection is required.

For WebSocket, the `connectingPayload` provides the parameters you would typically specify in your request headers.

Note that this must be set **when the `WebSocketTransport` is created**. If you need to update the `connectingPayload`, you need to recreate the client using a new `webSocketTransport`.

```swift
let webSocketTransport: WebSocketTransport = {
  let url = URL(string: "ws://localhost:8080/websocket")!
  let webSocketClient = WebSocket(url: url, protocol: .graphql_transport_ws)
  let authPayload = ["authToken": myAuthToken]
  return WebSocketTransport(websocket: webSocketClient, connectingPayload: authPayload)
}()
```

### HTTP

The default `NetworkTransport` for Apollo iOS is the [`RequestChainNetworkTransport`](../docc/documentation/apollo/requestchainnetworktransport). In Apollo iOS `1.1.0` and later, this transport supports subscriptions over HTTP, with no additional configuration required. 

> See the instructions for [creating a client](../networking/client-creation).

## Generating and executing

Apollo iOS supports subscriptions via [code generation](../code-generation/introduction/). Similar to queries, subscriptions are represented by instances of generated classes, conforming to the `GraphQLSubscription` protocol.

```graphql title="ReviewAddedSubscription.graphql"
subscription ReviewAdded {
  reviewAdded {
    id
    stars
  }
}
```

After you generate these classes, you can execute subscriptions using `ApolloClient.subscribe(subscription:)` with a [subscription-supporting `NetworkTransport`](#enabling-support). If you do, your client continues to receive updated data until the subscription is [canceled](#canceling-a-subscription).

```swift
let subscription = client.subscribe(subscription: ReviewAddedSubscription()) { result in
  guard let data = try? result.get().data else { return }
  print(data.reviews.map { $0.stars })
}
```

> **Note:** GraphQL subscriptions are distinct from [watching queries](./queries#watching-queries). A query watcher is only updated when new data is written to the local cache (usually by another network operation). A GraphQL subscription is a long-lived request that might receive updated data from the server continually.

## Canceling a subscription

It's important to cancel a subscription connection whenever you're done with it. As long as a subscription is active, it maintains a connection to the server, and its `resultHandler` completion block is retained. This can create memory leaks and reduce your application's performance.

When you call `ApolloClient.subscribe(subscription:)` an opaque `Cancellable` is returned. You can cancel the subscription by calling `cancel()` on the returned `Cancellable`. This terminates the connection to the server and releases the `resultHandler` completion block.

**A subscription's cancellation object does not cancel itself when it's deallocated!** Make sure to `cancel()` it yourself. A `class` can ensure any subscriptions it manages are canceled when it's released by using its deinitializer:

```swift
class ReviewViewController {

  let client: ApolloClient!
  private var subscription: Cancellable?

  func subscribeToReviews() {
    // Keep a reference to the subscription's cancellation object.
    self.subscription = client.subscribe(subscription: ReviewAddedSubscription()) { [weak self] result in
      // Handle each update from the subscription.
    }
  }

  deinit {
    // Make sure the subscription is cancelled, if it exists, when this object is deallocated.
    self.subscription?.cancel()
  }
}
```
