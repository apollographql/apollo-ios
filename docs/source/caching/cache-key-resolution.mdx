title: Custom cache keys
---

When working with a [normalized cache](./introduction#what-is-a-normalized-cache), it is recommended that you specify a **cache ID** for each object type in your schema. If you don't, objects are assigned a *default* cache ID, but that ID can lead to undesirable duplication of data.

The normalized cache computes a **cache key** for each object that is stored in the cache. With Apollo iOS, you can customize the computation of **cache keys** to improve the performance and capabilities of your cache.

> To learn more, read about how the cache [normalizes objects by cache key](./introduction#normalizing-objects-by-cache-key).

## `CacheKeyInfo`

The information needed to construct a **cache key** is represented by a [`CacheKeyInfo`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/docc/documentation/apolloapi/cachekeyinfo) value. This `struct` consists of two properties you can provide to  affect how a cache key is computed:

1. `let uniqueKeyGroup: String?`

    An optional **group identifier** for a set of objects that should be grouped together in the normalized cache. This is used as the first component of the **cache key**.

    > #### Important: Cache key group uniqueness
    >
    > All objects with the same `uniqueKeyGroup` must have unique `id`s across all types.

    To prevent cache key collisions, cache keys will always have a **group identifier** component. When the `uniqueKeyGroup` is `nil` (the default value), to [`__typename`](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-Type-Name-Introspection) of the response object is used as the **group identifier** by default.

    If multiple distinct types can be grouped together in the cache, the `CacheKeyInfo` for each `Object` should have the same `uniqueKeyGroup`.

    > **Tip:** By grouping objects together, their **keys** in the normalized cache will have the same prefix. This allows you to search for cached objects in the same group by their cache `id`. To learn more, read about [direct cache access](./cache-transactions)

2. `let id: String`

    The unique **cache ID** representing the object. This is used as the second component of the **cache key**.

    > #### Important: Cache ID uniqueness
    >
    > The ID must be deterministic and unique for all objects with the same **group identifier** (`__typename` or `uniqueKeyGroup`).
    >
    >That is, the key will be the same every time for a response object representing the same entity in the cache and the same key will never be used for reponse objects representing different objects that also have the same **group identifier**.

The normalized cache constructs cache keys with the format:

`"${GroupIdentifier}:${CacheID}"`

Given a `CacheKeyInfo`:
```swift
CacheKeyInfo(id: "123", uniqueKeyGroup: "Animal")
```
Apollo iOS would construct a cache key of `"Animal:123"`.

## The `SchemaConfiguration` file

The `SchemaConfiguration` file is your entry point to configuring **cache keys** for the types in your schema.

When Apollo iOS [generates code for your project](../code-generation/introduction), it will generate a set of metadata types representing the GraphQL schema for your application. One of these files is named `SchemaConfiguration.swift`.

 The code generation engine creates this file if it doesn't exist yet, but never overwrites an existing `SchemaConfiguration.swift` file. This means you can edit your schema configuration without those changes being overwritten on subsequent code generation runs.

> *Tip:* You can configure the location of the generated schema types with the [`output.schemaTypes` option in your code generation configuration](./../code-generation/codegen-configuration).

## Specifying cache IDs

The `SchemaConfiguration` contains a [`cacheKeyInfo(for type:object:)`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/docc/documentation/apolloapi/schemaconfiguration/cachekeyinfo(for:object:)) function. This function provides you a JSON response `object` and the concrete `type` of the object represented by the response.

The `object` parameter provides a JSON response from either a network request or a cache hit.

The `type` parameter provides a strongly typed [`Object`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/docc/documentation/apolloapi/object) type. This is a generated metadata type representing a concrete `type` in your GraphQL schema.

To configure how cache keys are computed from a response object, you can create and return [`CacheKeyInfo`](#cachekeyinfo) values from your implementation of [`cacheKeyInfo(for:object:)`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/docc/documentation/apolloapi/schemaconfiguration/cachekeyinfo(for:object:)).

> **Note:** When specifying **cache IDs**, make sure that you are always fetching the fields used to construct those IDs in your operations. Any response objects that don't contain the **cache ID** fields will not be able to be [merged via cache normalization](./introduction#normalizing-responses).

### Using a default cache ID field

If your schema provides a common unique identifier across many of your objects types, you may want to use that field as the **cache ID** by default.

```swift title="SchemaConfiguration.swift"
public enum SchemaConfiguration: ApolloAPI.SchemaConfiguration {
  static func cacheKeyInfo(for type: Object, object: JSONObject) -> CacheKeyInfo? {
    guard let id = object["id"] as? String else {
        return nil
    }

    return CacheKeyInfo(id: id)
  }
}
```

If the JSON response `object` has no `id` field, the function returns `nil` and the cache will normalize the object using the [default response path normalization](./introduction#normalizing-responses).

#### JSON value convenience initializer

Alternatively, you can use the [`init(jsonValue:uniqueKeyGroup:)`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/docc/documentation/apolloapi/cachekeyinfo/init(jsonvalue:uniquekeygroupid:)) convenience initializer. This initializer attempts to use the value of a key in the JSON response, throwing an error if the key does not exist.

If you want to return `nil` when the value does not exist, you can use `try?`.

```swift title="SchemaConfiguration.swift"
public enum SchemaConfiguration: ApolloAPI.SchemaConfiguration {
  static func cacheKeyInfo(for type: Object, object: JSONObject) -> CacheKeyInfo? {
    return try? CacheKeyInfo(jsonValue: object["id"])
  }
}
```

### Specifying cache IDs by `Object` type

If you would like to specify **cache IDs** differently for different types of objects, you can use the `type` parameter.

For an object of the type `Dog` with a unique key represented by an `id` field, you may implement cache key resolution as:

```swift title="SchemaConfiguration.swift"
public enum SchemaConfiguration: ApolloAPI.SchemaConfiguration {
  static func cacheKeyInfo(for type: Object, object: JSONObject) -> CacheKeyInfo? {
    switch type {
    case Objects.Dog:
      return try? CacheKeyInfo(jsonValue: object["id"])

      default:
      return nil
    }
  }
}
```

### Specifying cache IDs by abstract types

If object types sharing the same `interface` or `union` in your schema have the same cache key resolution strategy, you can resolve the key based on those abstract types.

The generated schema metadata includes `Interfaces` and `Unions` types that contain a list of all the abstract types used in your GraphQL schema.

For example, for a schema with `Dog` and `Cat` types that implement `interface Pet`, you may implement cache key resolution as:

```swift title="SchemaConfiguration.swift"
public enum SchemaConfiguration: ApolloAPI.SchemaConfiguration {
  static func cacheKeyInfo(for type: Object, object: JSONObject) -> CacheKeyInfo? {
    if type.implements(Interfaces.Pet) {
      return try? CacheKeyInfo(jsonValue: object["id"])
    }

    return nil
  }
}
```

To instead configure cache key resolution based on a `union` type, use the union's [`possibleTypes`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/docc/documentation/apolloapi/union/possibletypes) property.

```swift title="SchemaConfiguration.swift"
public enum SchemaConfiguration: ApolloAPI.SchemaConfiguration {
  static func cacheKeyInfo(for type: Object, object: JSONObject) -> CacheKeyInfo? {
    if Unions.ClassroomPets.possibleTypes.contains(type) {
      return try? CacheKeyInfo(jsonValue: object["id"])
    }

    return nil
  }
}
```

### Grouping cached objects with `uniqueKeyGroup`

If your **cache IDs** values are guaranteed to be unique across a number of different types, you may want to group them together in the cache with a common [`uniqueKeyGroup`](#cachekeyinfo).

> See [`uniqueKeyGroup`](#cachekeyinfo) for more information on grouping cached objects.

For example, if all objects that implement `interface Animal` will have unique **cache IDs**, whether they are `Dog`, `Cat`, or any other type that implements `Animal`, they can share a `uniqueKeyGroup`.

```swift title="SchemaConfiguration.swift"
public enum SchemaConfiguration: ApolloAPI.SchemaConfiguration {
  static func cacheKeyInfo(for type: Object, object: JSONObject) -> CacheKeyInfo? {
    if type.implements(Interfaces.Pet) {
      return try? CacheKeyInfo(
        jsonValue: object["id"],
        uniqueKeyGroupId: Interfaces.Pet.name
      )
    }

    return nil
  }
}
```
