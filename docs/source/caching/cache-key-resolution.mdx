title: Custom cache IDs
---

When working with a [normalized cache](./introduction#what-is-a-normalized-cache), it is recommended that you specify a **cache ID** for each object type in your schema. If you don't, objects are assigned a *default* cache ID, but that ID can lead to undesirable duplication of data.

The normalized cache computes a **cache key** for each object that is stored in the cache. That **cache key** is a combination of the object's [`__typename`](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-Type-Name-Introspection) and its **cache ID**. By default, a normalized cache [uses the response path of the object](./introduction#normalizing-responses) as the **cache ID**.

With Apollo iOS, you can customize the computation of **cache IDs** to improve the performance and capabilities of your cache.
