import SeparateLocalCacheMutationsNote from "../../shared/separate-local-cache-mutation-note.mdx"

Apollo iOS provides the ability to directly read and update the cache as needed using type-safe generated operation models. This provides a strongly-typed interface for accessing your cache data in pure Swift code.

The `ApolloStore` has APIs for accessing the cache via both `ReadTransaction` and `ReadWriteTransaction`.

> This article explains how you can access cache data directly. To learn how you can use the cache alongside network requests to fetch data for your GraphQL operations, read our documentation on [fetching locally cached data](./../fetching/fetching-data#fetching-locally-cached-data).

## Reading cache data

You can read data from the local cache directly with [`ApolloStore.withinReadTransaction(_:callbackQueue:completion:)`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/docc/documentation/apollo/apollostore/withinreadtransaction(_:callbackqueue:completion:)). The transaction block provides a [`ReadTransaction`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/docc/documentation/apollo/apollostore/readtransaction).

A [`ReadTransaction`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/docc/documentation/apollo/apollostore/readtransaction) can be used to read any of your [generated GraphQL queries or fragments](./../fetching/fetching-data#generated-operation-models).

```swift
// Read from a GraphQL Query
client.store.withinReadTransaction({ transaction in
  let data = try transaction.read(
    query: HeroNameQuery(episode: .jedi)
  )
  print(data.hero?.name)
})

// Read from a GraphQL fragment
client.store.withinReadTransaction({ transaction -> HeroDetails in
  let data = try transaction.readObject(
    ofType: HeroDetails.self,
    withKey: "Hero:123"
  )

  print(data.hero?.name)
})
```

## Writing cache data

You can write data to the local cache with [`ApolloStore.withinReadWriteTransaction(_:callbackQueue:completion:)`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/docc/documentation/apollo/apollostore/withinreadwritetransaction(_:callbackqueue:completion:)). The transaction block provides a [`ReadWriteTransaction`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/docc/documentation/apollo/apollostore/readwritetransaction). In addition the the ability to write data to the cache, [`ReadWriteTransaction`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/docc/documentation/apollo/apollostore/readwritetransaction) has all of the functionality of a `ReadTransaction`. To write data to the cache, you'll need to define a [`LocalCacheMutation`](#defining-local-cache-mutations).

### Defining local cache mutations

Like [reading cache data](#reading-cache-data), writing to the cache uses type-safe generated models. However, because the generated models for your operations and fragments are immutable, you cannot change the values on these models to write them to the cache. In order to write to the cache, you can define a [`LocalCacheMutation`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/docc/documentation/apolloapi/localcachemutation).

A [`LocalCacheMutation`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/docc/documentation/apolloapi/localcachemutation) is just a [GraphQL query or fragment definition](./../fetching/fetching-data#defining-operations) that has been flagged as a local cache mutation using the Apollo iOS specific directive `@apollo_client_ios_localCacheMutation`.

When a query or fragment with this directive is defined, the code generation engine will generate a mutable model that can be used with a [`ReadWriteTransaction`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/docc/documentation/apollo/apollostore/readwritetransaction) to write data to the cache.

> Your query definitions can also define variables for these operations to mutate cache data for fields with input arguments. For more information see our [operation argument documentation](./../fetching/operation-arguments).

<CodeColumns>

```graphql title="Mutable Query Definition"
query HeroNameLocalCacheMutation(
  $episode: Episode!
) @apollo_client_ios_localCacheMutation {
  hero(episode: $episode) {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

```graphql title="Mutable Fragment Definition"
fragment MutableHeroDetails on Hero
@apollo_client_ios_localCacheMutation {
  id
  name
}
```

</CodeColumns>

The generated models for your mutations will have mutable fields (`var` instead of `let`). Generating both getters and setters for fields on the mutable models means that they are larger than immutable generated models.

### Writing local cache mutations to the cache

Once you have generated mutable query models, you can use them with [`ReadWriteTransaction.update()`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/docc/documentation/apollo/apollostore/readwritetransaction/update(_:_:)).

```swift title="Local Cache Mutation Update"
store.withinReadWriteTransaction({ transaction in
  let cacheMutation = HeroNameLocalCacheMutation(episode: .CLONES)

  try transaction.update(cacheMutation) { (data: inout HeroNameLocalCacheMutation.Data) in
    data.hero.name = "General Kenobi"
  }

  let queryData = try transaction.read(
    query: HeroNameQuery(episode: .jedi)
  )
  print(queryData.hero?.name) // "General Kenobi"
})

```

### Writing mutable fragments to the cache

To write data for a mutable fragment, use [`ReadWriteTransaction.updateObject(ofType:withKey:variables:_:)`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/docc/documentation/apollo/apollostore/readwritetransaction/updateobject(oftype:withkey:variables:_:)). You will need to pass the cache key of the object you want to update along with the mutable fragment.

> For more information on cache keys in the normalized cache, check out our documentation on [normalized cache responses](./introduction#normalizing-responses).

```swift title="Mutable Fragment Update"
store.withinReadWriteTransaction({ transaction in
  try transaction.updateObject(
    ofType MutableHeroDetails.self,
    withKey: "Hero:123"
  ) { (data: inout MutableHeroDetails) in
    data.hero.name = "General Kenobi"

    let queryData = try transaction.read(
      query: HeroNameQuery(episode: .jedi)
    )

    print(queryData.hero?.name) // "General Kenobi"
  }
})
```

## Deleting cache data

There are presently three deletion methods available:

1. `ApolloStore.clear`

  Removes all data from the cache immediately.

2. `ReadWriteTransaction.removeObject(for:)`

  Removes a single object for the given `CacheKey`.

3. `ReadWriteTransaction.removeObjects(matching:)`

  Removes all objects with a `CacheKey` that matches the given pattern. Pattern matching is **not** case sensitive. For an in memory cache it is the equivalent of checking whether the cache key _contains_ the pattern and `SQLite` caches will perform a `LIKE` query to remove the objects. This method can be very slow depending on the number of records in the cache, it is recommended that this method be called on a background queue.

The `removeObject(for:)` and `removeObjects(matching:)` functions will only remove things at the level of an object. They cannot remove individual properties from an object, and cannot remove outside references **to** an object.

Deleting an object from the cache does _not_ perform cascading deletions. That is, if you remove an object which has a reference to another object, the reference will be removed, but that other object will not be removed and will remain in the cache. Likewise, if you delete an object, references _to_ that object will not be deleted, they will simply fail, causing a cache miss, when you attempt to load the object again.

This means that if you are planning to remove something, be sure that you either:

A) Know for sure you no longer need it

or

B) Are fine with your cache policy potentially triggering an additional fetch if the missing value causes a read to fail

> **Note:** As of right now, there is not a way to delete a single property's value. For instance, calling `try transaction.removeRecord(for: "2001.name")` will result in no action, as there would not be a record with the cache key `"2001.name"`, since `name` is a scalar field on the `"2001"` record.

### Deleting objects by cache key

> You will need to have a clear understanding of how you are generating cache keys to be able to use this functionality effectively. To help you figure out how to construct a cache key or pattern to delete, we recommend having a clear understanding of [how cache keys are generated](./introduction#normalizing-responses) and [configuring custom cache keys](./cache-key-resolution) for your cache objects.

Removing objects by their cache key allows you to clear stale or unneeded cache data without deleting the entire cache.

In Apollo iOS, you can [configure custom cache keys for your objects](./cache-key-resolution). The key for an entry in the cache that uses custom cache IDs will have the format `${ObjectType}:${CustomCacheKey).

In this example, we've configured our cache to attempt to use the `id` field as a cache ID.

```swift title="SchemaConfiguration.swift"
static func cacheKeyInfo(for type: Object, object: JSONObject) -> CacheKeyInfo? {
  try? CacheKeyInfo(jsonValue: object["id"])
}
```

This indicates that for every object which has an `id` field, its cache ID will be the value of the `id` field.

If you have previously fetched a `Book` object with the ID `"2001"`, the key for that entry in the cache will be `"Book:2001"`. To delete this object from the cache, you can call `transaction.removeObject(for: "Book:2001")` within a `ReadWriteTransaction`. This will remove the cache entry with that key, along with all of its associated scalar properties and the references to other objects it stores.

We can also delete all objects of a concrete object type from the cache. To remove all `Book` objects, you can use `transaction.removeObjects(matching: "Book:")`.
