title: Creating a client
---

Before you can execute GraphQL operations in your app, you need to initialize an `ApolloClient` instance.

## Basic client creation

In most cases, you can create a single shared instance of `ApolloClient` and point it at your GraphQL server. The recommended way to do this is to create a singleton like so:

```swift
import Foundation
import Apollo

class Network {
  static let shared = Network()

  private(set) lazy var apollo = ApolloClient(url: URL(string: "http://localhost:4000/graphql")!)
}
```

Under the hood, this creates a client using the default network transport (`RequestChainNetworkTransport`) and default configuration. You can then use this client from anywhere in your code with `Network.shared.apollo`.

> You should use this initializer unless you need to customize your client's network communication, such as to enable subscription operations.

## Advanced client creation

For advanced use cases, you can use a different `ApolloClient` initializer that enables you to customize your client's network transport:

```swift
public init(networkTransport: NetworkTransport,
            store: ApolloStore)
```

Apollo iOS provides the following classes that conform to the [`NetworkTransport` protocol](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/blob/main/Sources/Apollo/NetworkTransport.swift):

| Class | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `RequestChainNetworkTransport` | Passes a request through a chain of interceptors that can interact with the request both before and after it's transmitted. Uses standard HTTP requests to communicate with the server. |
| `WebSocketTransport` | Transmits _all_ GraphQL operations via WebSocket. Requires the `Apollo/WebSocket` sub-spec. |
| `SplitNetworkTransport` | Transmits subscription operations via WebSocket and other operations via HTTP. Requires the `Apollo/WebSocket` sub-spec. |
