> #### Separating cache mutations from network operations
>
> By flagging a query as a `LocalCacheMutation`, the generated model for that cache mutation no longer conforms to `GraphQLQuery`. This means you can no longer use that cache mutation as a query operation.
>
> Fundamentally, this is because cache mutation models are *mutable*, whereas network response data is *immutable*. Cache mutations are designed to access and mutate only the data necessary. 
>
> If our cache mutation models were mutable, mutating them outside of a `ReadWriteTransaction` wouldn't persist any changes to the cache. Additionally, mutable data models require nearly double the generated code. By maintaining immutable models, we avoid this confusion and reduce our generated code.
>
> Avoid creating mutable versions of entire query operations. Instead, define mutable fragments or queries to mutate only the fields necessary.
