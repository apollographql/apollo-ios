#### Separating cache mutations from network operations

By flagging a query as a `LocalCacheMutation`, the generated model for that cache mutation no longer conforms to `GraphQLQuery`. This means you can no longer use that cache mutation as a query operation.

Fundamentally, this is because cache mutation models are *mutable*, whereas network response data is *immutable*. Cache mutations are designed to access and mutate only the data necessary. 

If our cache mutation models were mutable, mutating them outside of a `ReadWriteTransaction` wouldn't persist any changes to the cache. Additionally, mutable data requires more generated code, and making mutable models for every operation could increase your total operation count twofold. By maintaining immutable models, we avoid this confusion and keep our operation count low.

You should avoid creating mutable versions of entire query operations. Instead, define mutable fragments or queries to mutate only the necessary fields.
