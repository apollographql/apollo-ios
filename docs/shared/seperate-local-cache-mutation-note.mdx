> #### Seperating Cache Mutations from Network Operations
>
> The generated models for queries defined as cache mutations will conform to `LocalCacheMutation`, but not `GraphQLQuery`. This means they cannot be sent as query operations to your server using an `ApolloClient`. Because network response data is immutable and cache mutation models are mutable, you must use seperate models.
>
> Because mutable data requires a lot more generated code, generating mutable models for all operations would nearly double the size of the generated operations. Additionally, if the models were mutable, mutating them outside of a `ReadWriteTransaction` would not persist any changes to the cache. By maintaining immutable models, we avoid any confusion this could cause.
>
> Cache mutations are designed to be narrowly scoped to access and mutate only the necessary data. You should avoid creating mutable versions of entire query operations. Instead, define mutable fragments or queries to mutate only the necessary fields.
