If using Swift Package Manager within an Xcode project or workspace, use the Xcode project configuration UI to add the Apollo iOS package.

Go to **File > Add Packages...**

In the dialog that appears, paste the URL of the Apollo iOS GitHub repo (`https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios.git`) into the search bar, then select the `apollo-ios` package that appears:

Select which version you want to use ([see version history](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/releases)), then click **Add Package**.

> **Note:** Xcode might not automatically select the latest version number, please check.

Select which packages you want to use. If you're getting started, we recommend selecting just the main `Apollo` library for now. You can always add other packages later if you need them.

> **Notes:** 
> 1. Do not select the `Apollo-Dynamic` product unless your project is configured to use dynamic linking of the Apollo iOS framework. Most projects do not need to link to this product.
> 2. **Do not select the `apollo-ios-cli` package.** This product is the CLI executable for code generation. If you link it to your project as a dependency it **will** cause build errors.

Then, click **Add Package**.
