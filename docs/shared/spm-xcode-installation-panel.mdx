If using Swift Package Manager within an Xcode project or workspace, use the Xcode project configuration UI to add the Apollo iOS package.

In the dialog that appears, paste the URL of the Apollo iOS GitHub repo (`https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios.git`) into the search bar, then select the `apollo-ios` package that appears:

Select which version you want to use ([see version history](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/releases)), then click **Add Package**.

> **Note:** Xcode might not automatically select the latest version number, please check.

<ExpansionPanelListItem>

Select which packages you want to use. If you're getting started, we recommend selecting just the main `Apollo` library for now. You can always add other packages later if you need them.

> **Note:** Do **not** select the `Apollo-Dynamic` target. This target is only for projects that link to Apollo iOS. Most projects do not need to do this.

Then, click **Add Package**.

You're done!
