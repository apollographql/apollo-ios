<ExpansionPanel title="Carthage Run Script">

In the never-ending battle of what's going to be more painful when it comes to dependency management, we've decided to make working with Carthage a bit more of a pain in order to make working with NPM way less of a pain. 

The scripts and binaries which you need to generate code will be included in the `Carthage/Checkouts` folder. If this folder is not checked into version control, all developers on a team (and your CI machine) will need to run `carthage checkout` when changes are made to the version to ensure they have the correct underlying binaries and scripts.

Once everyone's on the same page about that, you should be able to use this build script:

```sh
SCRIPT_PATH="${SRCROOT}/Carthage/Checkouts/apollo-ios/scripts"
cd "${SRCROOT}/${TARGET_NAME}"
"${SCRIPT_PATH}"/run-bundled-codegen.sh codegen:generate --target=swift --includes=./**/*.graphql --localSchemaFile="schema.json" API.swift
```
