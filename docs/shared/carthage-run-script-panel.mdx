<ExpansionPanel title="Carthage Run Script">

The scripts and binaries that you need to generate code are included in the `Carthage/Checkouts` folder. If this folder is not checked into version control, all developers on a team (and your CI machine) need to run `carthage checkout` when changes are made to the version to ensure they have the correct underlying binaries and scripts.

Team members can then use this build script:

```bash
# Don't run this during index builds
if [ $ACTION = "indexbuild" ]; then exit 0; fi

SCRIPT_PATH="${SRCROOT}/Carthage/Checkouts/apollo-ios/scripts"
cd "${SRCROOT}/${TARGET_NAME}"
"${SCRIPT_PATH}"/run-bundled-codegen.sh codegen:generate --target=swift --includes=./**/*.graphql --localSchemaFile="schema.json" API.swift
```
