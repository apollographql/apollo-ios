#### Check out and build dependencies

Run `carthage update --use-xcframeworks --platform ios` (or `--platform ios,macos` to build both Mac and iOS).

</ExpansionPanelListItem>

#### Add built frameworks to your project

Drag and drop `Apollo.xcframework` and `ApolloAPI.xcframework` from the `Carthage/Build` folder to the **Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content** section of your application target's **General** settings tab.
  - To include the `ApolloSQLite` library, also drag `ApolloSQLite.xcframework` to this area.
  - To include the `ApolloWebSocket` library, also drag `ApolloWebSocket.xcframework` to this area.

#### Work around Carthage submission bug

On your application target's **Build Phases** settings tab, click the **+** icon and choose **New Run Script Phase**. Create a Run Script in which you specify your shell (e.g., `bin/sh`) and add the following contents to the script area below the shell:

 ```sh
 /usr/local/bin/carthage copy-frameworks
 ```

Then, add the paths to the frameworks you want to use under **Input Files**, e.g.:

 ```
 $(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/Apollo.xcframework
 $(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/ApolloAPI.xcframework
 ```

Again, if you're adding `ApolloSQLite` or `ApolloWebSocket`, please make sure to add the other frameworks you added as Input Files.
