#### Set up your `Cartfile`

Add `github "apollographql/apollo-ios"` to your Cartfile.

</ExpansionPanelListItem>
<ExpansionPanelListItem>

#### Check out and build dependencies

Run `carthage update --use-xcframeworks --platform ios` (or `--platform ios,macos` to build both Mac and iOS).

> **Note:** There's an issue with the way Carthage uses Lipo in the Xcode 12 GM. Please `cd` into `[YourProject]/Carthage/Checkouts/apollo-ios/scripts` and then run `./carthage-build-workaround.sh` to resolve this build issue.

</ExpansionPanelListItem>
<ExpansionPanelListItem>

#### Add built frameworks to your project

Drag and drop `Apollo.framework` and `ApolloAPI.framework` from the appropriate `Carthage/Build/iOS` or `Carthage/Build/Mac` folder to the **Embedded Binaries** section of your application target's **General** settings tab. This should also cause them to appear in the **Linked Frameworks And Libraries** section automatically.
  - To include the `ApolloSQLite` library, also drag `ApolloSQLite.framework` and `SQLite.framework` to this area.
  - To include the `ApolloWebSocket` library, also drag `ApolloWebSocket.framework` and `Starscream.framework` to this area.

#### Work around Carthage submission bug

On your application target's **Build Phases** settings tab, click the **+** icon and choose **New Run Script Phase**. Create a Run Script in which you specify your shell (e.g., `bin/sh`) and add the following contents to the script area below the shell:

 ```sh
 /usr/local/bin/carthage copy-frameworks
 ```

Then, add the paths to the frameworks you want to use under **Input Files**, e.g.:

 ```
 $(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/Apollo.framework
 $(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/ApolloAPI.framework
 ```

Again, if you're adding `ApolloSQLite` or `ApolloWebSocket`, please make sure to add the other frameworks you added as Input Files.

This script works around an [App Store submission bug](http://www.openradar.me/radar?id=6409498411401216) triggered by universal binaries and ensures that necessary bitcode-related files and dSYMs are copied when archiving.
