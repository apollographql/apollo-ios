Apollo iOS compiles the Codegen CLI during `pod install`. This ensures you always have a valid CLI version for your Apollo iOS version.

The Codegen CLI is located in your project at `Pods/Apollo/apollo-ios-cli`

#### Initialize the code generation configuration

The Codegen CLI uses a JSON file to configure the code generation engine. Use the Codegen CLI `init` command to create this file with default values. From the directory of your `Podfile`, run:

```bash
./Pods/Apollo/apollo-ios-cli init --schema-name ${MySchemaName}
```

`${MySchemaName}` should be the name you want for the namespace of your generated schema files.

This will create an `apollo-codegen-config.json` file with the default values.

#### Configure code generation options

Open the `apollo-codegen-config.json` file to configure code generation for your project.

The default configuration will:
- Find all GraphQL schema files ending with the file extension `.graphqls` within your project directory.
- Find all GraphQL operation and fragment definition files ending with the file extension `.graphql` within your project directory.
- Generate Swift code for the schema types in a directory with the `schema-name` provided.
- Generate Swift code for the operation and fragment models relative to the `.graphql` files that define them.

#### Run code generation

From the directory of your `Podfile` file, run:

```bash
./Pods/Apollo/apollo-ios-cli generate
```

Your generated files will be created with the file extension `.graphql.swift`.

#### Add the generated schema and operation files to your target

By default, a directory containing your generated schema files will be located in a directory with the `schema-name` you provided; your generated operation and fragment files will be in the same location as the `.graphql` files they are defined by.

When using Cocoapods, you will need to manually add the generated files to your target.

> **Note:** Because adding generated files to your Xcode targets must be done manually each time you generate new files, we highly recommend defining your project targets with SPM. For more information see the documentation for [Code Generation Confiugration](./codegen-configuration).
