<ExpansionPanel title="SPM with Package.swift">

If your project uses its own `Package.swift` file, you can add Apollo iOS as a dependency there:

<ExpansionPanelList>
<ExpansionPanelListItem>

Add `Apollo iOS` to your `dependencies` list:

```swift title="Package.swift"
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.0.0")),
],
```

</ExpansionPanelListItem>

<ExpansionPanelListItem>

Link the `Apollo` product to your package target.

Any targets in your application that will use the `ApolloClient` need to have a dependency on the `Apollo` product.

```swift title="Package.swift"
.target(
    name: "MyApp",
    dependencies: [
        .product(name: "Apollo", package: "apollo-ios"),
    ]
)
```

> **Note:** Targets that will only use Apollo's generated models don't need to be linked to the `Apollo` product.
