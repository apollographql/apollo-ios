<ExpansionPanel title="Swift Package Manager Run Script">

If you're using Xcode 11 or higher, SPM will check out the appropriate build script along with the rest of the files when it checks out the repo. Add the following to your Run Script build phase: 

```sh
# Go to the build root and search up the chain to find the Derived Data Path where the source packages are checked out.
DERIVED_DATA_CANDIDATE="${BUILD_ROOT}"

while ! [ -d "${DERIVED_DATA_CANDIDATE}/SourcePackages" ]; do
  if [ "${DERIVED_DATA_CANDIDATE}" = / ]; then
    echo >&2 "error: Unable to locate SourcePackages directory from BUILD_ROOT: '${BUILD_ROOT}'"
    exit 1
  fi

  DERIVED_DATA_CANDIDATE="$(dirname "${DERIVED_DATA_CANDIDATE}")"
done

# Grab a reference to the directory where scripts are checked out
SCRIPT_PATH="${DERIVED_DATA_CANDIDATE}/SourcePackages/checkouts/apollo-ios/scripts"

if [ -z "${SCRIPT_PATH}" ]; then
    echo >&2 "error: Couldn't find the CLI script in your checked out SPM packages; make sure to add the framework to your project."
    exit 1
fi

cd "${SRCROOT}/${TARGET_NAME}"
"${SCRIPT_PATH}"/run-bundled-codegen.sh codegen:generate --target=swift --includes=./**/*.graphql --localSchemaFile="schema.json" API.swift
```

> NOTE: If you try to use this with command line SPM, when you regenerate your `xcodeproj` this build script will get wiped out. We strongly recommend using Xcode 11's built-in SPM handling rather than the command line because of this.
