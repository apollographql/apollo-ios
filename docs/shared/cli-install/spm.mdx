The Apollo iOS SPM package includes the Codegen CLI as an executable target. This ensures you always have a valid CLI version for your Apollo iOS version.

To simplify accessing the Codegen CLI, you can run the included `apollo-cli-install` SPM plugin.

This plugin builds the CLI and creates a symbolic link to the executable in your project root.

When using a `Package.swift` file, install the CLI by running:

```bash
swift package --allow-writing-to-package-directory apollo-cli-install
```

After the plugin installs, it creates a symbolic link to the Codegen CLI named `apollo-ios-cli` in your project root folder. You can now run the CLI from the command line with `./apollo-ios-cli`.

> **Note:** Because the `apollo-ios-cli` in your project root is only a symbolic link, it only works if the compiled CLI executable exists. This is generally located in your Xcode Derived Data or the `.build` folder. If these are cleared, you can run the install plugin again to rebuild the CLI executable.
