When using Cocoapods, Apollo iOS compiles the Codegen CLI into an executable shell application during `pod install`, which is located in your project at `Pods/Apollo/apollo-ios-cli`.

After installing the Apollo iOS pod, you can run the Codegen CLI from the directory of your `Podfile`:

```bash
./Pods/Apollo/apollo-ios-cli ${Command Name} -${Command Arguments}
```
