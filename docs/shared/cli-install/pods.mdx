When using Cocoapods, Apollo iOS compiles the Codegen CLI into an executable shell application during `pod install`, which is located in your project at `Pods/Apollo/apollo-ios-cli`.

After installing the Apollo iOS pod, you can run the Codegen CLI from the directory of your `Podfile`:

```bash
./Pods/Apollo/apollo-ios-cli ${Command Name} -${Command Arguments}
```

> **Note:** If you are using `:path` in your Podfile to link to a local copy of Apollo iOS, the CLI will not be automatically available. You will need to manually build the Codegen CLI. See the [CLI installation guide](/ios/code-generation/codegen-cli#installation) for directions on how to do that.
