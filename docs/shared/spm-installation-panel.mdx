<ExpansionPanel title="Swift Package Manager Installation">

> **Note:** These instructions are for Xcode 11 or later. Xcode 11 is the first version of Xcode that integrates Swift Package manager, whereas older versions require using the command line. If you're using an older version of Xcode, we recommend using CocoaPods instead.

Select which version you want to use, then click **Next**.

> Xcode automatically suggests the current version, `Up to Next Major`. We **strongly** suggest that until the release of Apollo iOS `1.x`, you select `Up To Next Minor` instead, because we might release breaking changes on a minor version.

Select which packages you want to use, then click **Finish**.

> If you're getting started, we recommend selecting just the main `Apollo` library for now. You can always add other packages later if you need them.

> **Note:** Do **not** select the `Apollo-Dynamic` target. This target is only for  projects that link to Apollo iOS. Most projects do not need to do this.
