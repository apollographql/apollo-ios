#### Initialize the code generation configuration

The Codegen CLI uses a JSON file to configure the code generation engine. You can use the Codegen CLI's `init` command to create this file with default values.

From your project's root directory, run the following command with your customized values:

<CodeBlock
  code={props.cliPath + " init --schema-name ${MySchemaName} --module-type ${ModuleType}"}
  language="bash"
  showLineNumbers='true'
/>

- `${MySchemaName}` provides a name for the namespace of your generated schema files.
- `${ModuleType}` configures how your generated schema types are included in your project.
  > This is a crucial decision to make **before configuring code generation**. To determine the right option for your project, see [Project Configuration](/ios/project-configuration).
  >
  > To get started quickly, you can use the `embeddedInTarget` option.
  > Using `embeddedInTarget`, you must supply a target name using the `--target-name` command line option.

Running this command creates an `apollo-codegen-config.json` file.

#### Configure code generation options

Open your `apollo-codegen-config.json` file to start configuring code generation for your project.

The default configuration will:

- Find all GraphQL schema files ending with the file extension `.graphqls` within your project directory.
- Find all GraphQL operation and fragment definition files ending with the file extension `.graphql` within your project directory.
- Generate Swift code for the schema types in a directory with the `schema-name` provided.
- Generate Swift code for the operation and fragment models in a subfolder within the schema types output location.

#### Run code generation

From your project's root directory, run:

<CodeBlock
  code={props.cliPath + " generate"}
  language="bash"
  showLineNumbers='true'
/>

The code generation engine creates your files with the extension `.graphql.swift`.

#### Add the generated schema and operation files to your target

By default, a directory containing your generated schema files is within a directory with the schema name you provided (i.e., `MySchemaName`). Your generated operation and fragment files are in a subfolder within the same directory.

If you created your target in an Xcode project or workspace, you'll need to manually add the generated files to your target.

> **Note:** Because adding generated files to your Xcode targets must be done manually each time you generate new files, we highly recommend defining your project targets with SPM. Alternatively, you can generate your operations into the package that includes your schema files. For more information see the documentation for [Code Generation Configuration](/ios/code-generation/codegen-configuration).
