#### Initialize the code generation configuration

The Codegen CLI uses a JSON file to configure the code generation engine. You can use the Codegen CLI's `init` command to create this file with default values.

From your project's root directory, run the following command with your customized values:

<CodeBlock
  code={props.cliPath + " init --schema-name ${MySchemaName} --module-type ${ModuleType}"}
  language="bash"
  showLineNumbers='true'
/>

- `${MySchemaName}` provides a name for the namespace of your generated schema files.
- `${ModuleType}` configures how your generated schema types are included in your project.
  > This is a crucial decision to make **before configuring code generation**. To determine the right option for your project, see [Project Configuration](../project-configuration).
  >
  > To get started quickly, you can use the `.embeddedInTarget` option.
  > Using `.embeddedInTarget`, you must supply a target name using the `--target-name` command line option.

Running this command creates an `apollo-codegen-config.json` file.

#### Configure code generation options

Open your `apollo-codegen-config.json` file to start configuring code generation for your project.

The default configuration:
- Finds all GraphQL schema files ending with `.graphqls`
- Finds all GraphQL operation and fragment definition files ending with `.graphql`
- Generates Swift code for your schema types in a directory with the provided `MySchemaName`
- Generates Swift code for your operation and fragment models in a subfolder within the same directory

#### Run code generation

From your project's root directory, run:

<CodeBlock
  code={props.cliPath + " generate"}
  language="bash"
  showLineNumbers='true'
/>

The code generation engine creates your files with the extension `.graphql.swift`.

#### Add the generated schema and operation files to your target

By default, a directory containing your generated schema files is within a directory with the schema name you provided (i.e., `MySchemaName`). Your generated operation and fragment files are in a subfolder within the same directory.

If you created your target in an Xcode project or workspace, you'll need to manually add the generated files to your target.

> **Note:** Adding generated files to your Xcode targets must be done manually *each time* you generate new files. This is why we instead  recommend defining your project targets with SPM.
>
> Alternatively, you can generate your operations into the package that includes your schema files. For more information, see [Code Generation Configuration](../code-generation/codegen-configuration).
