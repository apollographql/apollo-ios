<ExpansionPanel title="CocoaPods Run Script">

Our CocoaPods install includes the code-generation scripts and binaries of the `apollo` CLI client as files which will not be added to the framework, but which you can still call from a Run Script Build Phase. Add the following to the Run Script:

```sh
SCRIPT_PATH="${PODS_ROOT}/Apollo/scripts"
cd "${SRCROOT}/${TARGET_NAME}"
"${SCRIPT_PATH}"/run-bundled-codegen.sh codegen:generate --target=swift --includes=./**/*.graphql --localSchemaFile="schema.json" API.swift
```
