The release checklist has been moved to a [Pull Request template](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/blob/main/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/pull-request-template-release.md). Unfortunately Pull Request templates aren't offered as a selection list when creating a new Pull Request, nor can a static link be used. To get the template contents in your new Pull Request you need to manually append the query parameter `template=pull-request-template-release.md` in the address bar once you've selected the compare branches.
