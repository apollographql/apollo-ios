# Change log

## v0.27.1
- Better defense against multithreading crashes in `URLSessionClient`. ([#1184](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/1184))
- Fix for watchOS availability for `URLSessionClient`. ([#1175](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/1175))

## v0.27.0
- **BREAKING**: Replaced calls directly into the closure based implementation of `URLSession` with a delegate-based implementation called `URLSessionClient`. 
    - This (finally) allows background session configurations to be used with `ApolloClient`, since background session configurations immediately error out if you try to use the closure-based `URLSession` API. 
    - **This makes a significant change to the initialization of `HTTPNetworkTransport` if you're using a custom `URLSession`**: Because `URLSession` must have its delegate set at the point of creation, `URLSessionClient` is now creating the URL session. You can initialize a `URLSessionClient` with a `URLSessionConfiguration`. if before you were using:

        ```swift
        let session = URLSession(configuration: myCustomConfiguration)
        let url = URL(string: "http://localhost:8080/graphql")!
        let transport = HTTPNetworkTransport(url: url,
                                             session: session)
        ```
        
        You will now need to use: 
        
        ```swift
        let client = URLSessionClient(sessionConfiguration: myCustomConfiguration)
        let url = URL(string: "http://localhost:8080/graphql")!
        let transport = HTTPNetworkTransport(url: url,
                                             client: client)
        ```
        
    - If you were passing in a session you'd already set yourself up to be the delegate of to handle GraphQL requests, you'll need to subclass `URLSessionClient`  and override any delegate methods off of `URLSessionDelegate`, `URLSessionTaskDelegate`, or `URLSessionDataDelegate` you need to handle. Unfortunately only one class can be a delegate at a time, and that class must be declared when the session is instantiated. 

        Note that if you don't need your existing delegate-based session to do any handling for things touched by Apollo, you can keep it completely separate if you'd prefer.
    - This does *not* change anything at the point of calls - everything is still closure-based in the end
   
      Please file bugs on this ASAP if you run into problems. Thank you! ([#1163](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/1163))


## v0.26.0
- **BREAKING**, though in a good way: Updated the typescript CLI to [2.27.2](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-tooling/releases/tag/apollo%402.27.2), and updated the script to pull from a CDN (currently backed by GitHub Releases) rather than old Circle images. This should significantly increase download performance and stability. ([#1166](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/1166))
- **BREAKING**: Updated the retry delegate to allow more fine-grained control of what error to return if an operation fails in the process of retrying. ([#1128](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/1128), [#1167](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/1167))
- Added support to the Swift scripting package to be able to use multiple headers when downloading a schema. ([#1153](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/1153))
- Added the ability to set the SSL trust validator on a websocket. ([#1124](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/1124))
- Fixed an issue deserializing custom scalars in `ApolloSQLite`. ([#1144](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/1144))

## v0.25.1

- Repoints download link to our CDN for the CLI for people on 0.25.0 who can't upgrade to 0.26.0 or higher immediately.

## v0.25.0
- **BREAKING**: Updated the `swift-tools` version to 5.2 in `Package.swift`. Note that if you're using `swift-tools` 5.2, you'll need to update the syntax of your `Package.swift` file and specify the name of the library manually for Apollo. ([#1099](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/1099), [#1106](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/1106))
- **POSSIBLY BREAKING**: Upgraded the typescript CLI to [2.26.0](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-tooling/releases/tag/apollo%402.26.0). No changes were found in test frameworks, but this could theoretically break some stuff. ([#1107](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/1107), [#1113](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/1113))
- **NEW**: Added the ability to set Starscream's underlying `enableSOCKSProxy` to better allow debugging web sockets in tools like Charles Proxy. ([#1108](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/1108))
- Fixed several issues using paths with spaces in the Swift Codegen. ([#1092](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/1092), [#1097](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/1097)). 
- `ApolloCodegenLib` is now properly passing the `header` argument last when downloading a schema. ([#1096](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/1096))
- Automatic Persisted Queries now also work with mutations. ([#1110](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/1110))

## v0.24.1
- Repoints download link to our CDN for the CLI for people on 0.24.0 who can't upgrade to 0.26.0 or higher immediately.

## v0.24.0
- **BREAKING**: Updated `GraphQLResponse` to be generic over the response type rather than the operation type. This will allow more flexibility for generic modifications to methods that need to use `GraphQLResponse`. ([#1061](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/1061))
- **BREAKING**: Updated the file URL-based initializer of `GraphQL` to throw with a clear error instead of failing silently. Removed the ability to pass in an input stream since that can't be recreated on a failure. Updated initializers take either raw `Data` or a file URL so that the input stream can be recreated on a retry. ([#1086](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/1086), [#1089](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/1089))
- In the Swift Package Manager based codegen, made sure that the folder the CLI will be downloaded to is created if it doesn't exist. ([#1069](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/1069))

## v0.23.3
- Repoints download link to our CDN for the CLI for people on 0.23.x who can't upgrade to 0.26.0 or higher immediately.

## v0.23.2
- Changed the `@available` flags added in 0.23.1 to `#if os(macOS)`, since the former is runtime and the latter is compile time, to work around a bug where SwiftUI compiles the `ApolloCodegenLib` library even if it's not included in the target being previewed. ([#1066](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/1066))
- Added support for `omitDeprecatedEnumCases` command line option I missed for `ApolloCodegenOptions` ([#1053](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/1053))

## v0.23.1
- Added some `@available` flags to prevent accidental compilation of `ApolloCodegenLib` on platforms other than macOS. ([#1041](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/1041))
- Made the `Query` on `GraphQLQueryWatcher` public so it can be referenced. ([#1037](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/1037))

## v0.23.0
- **BETA**: Now available, SPM-based code generation, Phase 0 of our transition to Swift Codegen.
  
    Note that the underlying codegen is still using `apollo-tooling`, but that will change as we proceed with Phase 1 of the [Swift Codegen Project](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/projects/2), generating the code in Swift.

    Documentation is available at our [Swift Scripting page](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/swift-scripting/).
  
    When this gets to the final version this **will** supersede existing codegen, so please file bugs galore on this so we can get it good to go as quickly as possible. Thank you! ([#940](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/940), [#1033](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/1033))\

- Fixed some memory leaks in our internal Promises implementation. ([#1016](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/1016))

### v0.22.1
- Repoints download link to our CDN for the CLI for people on 0.22.0 who can't upgrade to 0.26.0 or higher immediately.

### v0.22.0
- **BREAKING**: Updated CLI to [v2.22.1](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-tooling/releases/tag/apollo%402.22.1), including a bunch of fixes on the Swift side: 
    - Marked files which are generated as `@generated`
    - Added documentation to the constructors of input structs
    - Added additional type annotations to improve compile times.
- **BREAKING**: Updated delegate in `HTTPNetworkTransport` to be a `weak var` and to not be passed in as a parameter to the initializer. ([#990](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/990), [#1002](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/1002))
- Added a lock to `InMemoryNormalizedCache` to reduce possible race conditions. ([#552](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/552))
- Added the ability to not send duplicates on a websocket. ([#1004](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/1004))
- Fixed an issue that could lead to an undefined cache key in the SQLite library. ([#991](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/991))
- Fixed an issue where existing fetch operations in a watcher would not be canceled before a new one was started. ([#1012](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/1012))

### v0.21.1
- Repoints download link to our CDN for the CLI for people on 0.21.0 who can't upgrade to 0.26.0 or higher immediately.

### v0.21.0
- **BREAKING**, but by popular request: Removed the requirement that the `clientName` and `clientVersion` on `NetworkTransport`, and added a default implementation so custom implementations don't need to set these up themselves. ([#954](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/954))

### v0.20.1
- Repoints download link to our CDN for the CLI for people on 0.20.0 who can't upgrade to 0.26.0 or higher immediately.

### v0.20.0

- Fixed a bunch of data races in `ApolloWebSocket`. ([#880](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/880))
- Updated `ApolloWebSocket` to depend on `Apollo` in `Package.swift` since there is a dependency there. ([#906](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/906))
- **POSSIBLY BREAKING** Updated Swift tools verson in package declaration to 5.1. ([#883](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/883))

### v0.19.1
- Repoints download link to our CDN for the CLI for people on 0.19.0 who can't upgrade to 0.26.0 or higher immediately.

### v0.19.0
- **NEW**: Added a retry delegate to allow retries based on GraphQL errors returned from your server, not just network-level errors. NOTE: Be careful with which errors you retry for - the mere presence of an error doesn't necessarily indicate a full failure since GraphQL queries can return partial results. ([#770](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/770))
- **NEW**: Automatically generates ApolloEngine/ApolloGraphManager headers based on your main bundle's ID and version number. These can also be configured when you set up your `NetworkTransport` if you need something more granular for different versions of your application. ([#858](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/858))
- **POSSIBLY BREAKING**: The `NetworkTransport` protocol is now class-bound. If you built your own `NetworkTransport` implementation instead of one of the ones included with the library, this now must be a `class` instead of a `struct`. ([#770](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/770))
- **POSSIBLY BREAKING**: Removed an `unzip` method for arrays of arays which we were not using. However, since it was public, we figured we should let you know. ([#872](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/872))
- Bumped Starscream dependency to `3.1.1`. ([#873](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/873))

### v0.18.2
- Repoints download link to our CDN for the CLI for people on 0.18.x who can't upgrade to 0.26.0 or higher immediately.

### v0.18.1
- Removes TSAN from run on schemes to fix Carthage issue. ([#862](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/862))


### v0.18.0
- **POSSIBLY BREAKING**: Updated CLI to no longer be directly bundled, but to be downloaded if needed. This allows us to avoid bloating the iOS repo with the CLI zip, and to make it easier to test different versions of the CLI in the future. This change should automatically download the updated CLI version for you. 

  Note one significant change from prior bundled versions: If you are connected to the internet when you download the iOS dependency through SPM/Carthage/CocoaPods, you will now need to build your target while still connected to the internet in order to download the proper version of the CLI. Once the correct version of the CLI is downloaded, internet access should no longer be necessary to build. If you disconnect from the internet before the correct version downloads, you will not be able to build. ([#855](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/855))
- Updated version of CLI to download to [`2.21.0`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-tooling/releases/tag/apollo%402.21.0). ([#855](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/855)) This includes: 
    - Ability to have the codegen ignore deprecated enum cases by using the `--omitDeprecatedEnumCases` flag
    - Fix for generating input fields for `null` values
- Fixes a number of weak references with closures. Note [that this may reveal some places you weren't hanging onto a strong reference to your `ApolloClient` object](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/854#issuecomment-545673975), which will cause it to get deallocated. ([#854](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/854))

### v0.17.0
- **NEW**: Support for [Automatic Persisted Queries](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/performance/apq/). This feature allows you to send the hash of a query to your server, and if the server recognizes the hash, it can perform the whole query without you having to send it again. This is particularly useful for large queries, since it can reduce the amount of data you have to send from your user's device pretty significantly. ([#767](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/767))
- **BREAKING**: Removed old script files which have been deprecated. If you were still using these, please check out the updated [codegen build step setup instructions](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/installation/#adding-a-code-generation-build-step) to get up and running with the `run-bundled-codegen` script. ([#820](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/820))
- **POSSIBLY BREAKING**: Updated bundled CLI to v2.19.1. Please check out the [CLI changelog](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-tooling/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#apollo2191) for full details, but this version actually moves to using multi-line Swift strings for queries. If you prefer to have condensed queries, it also introduces a `--suppressSwiftMultilineStringLiterals` flag which produces single-line queries stripped of whitespace. ([#831](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/831))
- Fixed a couple places we were not using `LocalizedError` properly. ([#818](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/818))

### v0.16.1
- Updated the way `run-bundled-codegen` checks whether the bundled codegen has already been unzipped and has node locally. ([#806](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/806))
- Updated how default parameters are provided for `RequestCreatorProtocol`. ([#804](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/804))

### v0.16.0
- **BREAKING**: We've switched to a much simpler setup which does not involve NPM in order to use our CLI. This requires updating your build scripts. Please follow the [updated instructions for setting up the build script here](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/installation/#adding-a-code-generation-build-step). The existing build script will continue to work until the next minor release, at which point it will be removed. ([#766](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/766))
- Included CLI version fixes issues which showed up in `0.15.2`. 
- **BREAKING**: We've removed all public references to our internal `Promise` implementation, which was never intended to be public. ([#709](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/709))
- Fixed a deadlock in a transaction. ([#763](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/763), [#365](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/365))
- Added a `RequestCreatorProtocol` to allow you to more easily muck with and/or mock creating multipart requests. ([#771](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/771))
- Fixed an issue causing problems building with SPM in Xcode 11. ([#784](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/784))

### v0.15.3
- Revert CLI update from `0.15.2` due to unexpected build issues. 

### v0.15.2
- Update Apollo CLI requirement to 2.18. This should pull in a couple fixes to the CLI: 
    - Way better escaping of identifiers, types, and strings ([Tooling #1515](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-tooling/pull/1515))
    - Fix compiler warning when an optional has a `.none` case ([Tooling #1482](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-tooling/pull/1482))
  
  If you run into any weird build issues after this update, try deleting your local `node_modules` folder and rebuilding before filing an issue. ([#760](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/760))
- Better handling of the `localizedDescription` for `HTTPResponseError`. ([#756](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/756))

### v0.15.1
- Add platform name to framework bundle identifier to work around a change to app store submission. Please see the PR for more details. ([#751](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/751))
- Expose the initializer for `GraphQLQueryWatcher` so it can actually be instantiated. ([#750](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/750))

### v0.15.0
- **BREAKING**: Finally swapped out `URLSessionConfiguration` on initializer for `HTTPNetworkTransport` to use `URLSession` directly instead. If you were previously passing in a configuration, first hand it to a `URLSession` instance and then pass that instance into the initializer. 

  This allows many new things including: 
    - Support for background sessions
    - Easier mocking through `NSURLProtocol`
    - Certificate pinning
    - Self-signed certificates
    - Metrics inspection
    - Authentication challenge handling
 
 All these are pretty much entirely through the ability to use `URLSessionDelegate` directly since we're now accepting a `URLSession` you can declare yourself to be the delegate of rather than just the configuration. ([#699](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/699), inspired by [#265](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/265))
- **BREAKING**, though hopefully in a good way: Significant updates to the Upload functionality to make it conform more closely to the [GraphQL Upload Spec](). Also added a goodly bit of documentation around this functionality. ([#707](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/707))
- Way better support for Swift Package Manager, especially for `ApolloSQLite` and `ApolloWebSocket`. ([#674](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/674))
- Created `ApolloClientProtocol` to match all public methods of `ApolloClient` for easier mocking. ([#715](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/715), inspired by [#693](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/693))


### v0.14.0

- **BREAKING** Updated codegen to use 2.17 of the Apollo CLI. Please see the [full release notes](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-tooling/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#apollo2170-apollo-codegen-swift0350) for that version of the CLI, but in short: 
    - Stops force-unwrapping and instead nil-coalesce to `.none` when the thing being unwrapped was a double-optional, which was causing some crashes
    - Fixes issue where removing redundant modifiers was a little too agressive 
    - Fixes escaping for `Self` as a type name
    - Adds `CaseIterable` for all known cases of an enum. If you were adding this yourself previously, you'll have to take it back out.
    - Adds comment with original operation to `operationDefinition`, stripped excess whitespace from actual definition.

- Added explicit support for Catalyst builds. ([#688](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/688))
- Added support for `Int` custom scalars. ([#402](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/402))
- Exposed `clearCache` directly on stores so a store being used by multiple clients can be more explicitly cleared. ([#518](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/518))
- Fixed an issue where an error on cache write would not be propagated correctly. ([#673](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/673))
- Updated supported Node version to the Long-Term Support version. ([#672](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/672))

### v0.13.0 

**PLEASE READ THESE RELEASE NOTES BEFORE INSTALLING IF YOU WERE USING AN OLDER VERSION!**

- **SUPER-BREAKING**: Updated a ton of completion closures that could use it to use `Result` instead of optional parameter / optional error. ([#644](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/644)). There are a few details to this one to be particularly aware of: 
  - If you see a bunch of Swift build errors that are claiming **Generic Parameter "Query" could not be inferred**, that means you need to update your completion closure to take the single `Result<Parameter, Error>` parameter instead of the two (`Parameter?`, `Error?`) parameters. 
  - Particularly around caching, if there are places where **both** parameters were `nil` in previous iterations, you will now get an `Error`. This will generally be a `JSONDecodingError.missingValue`, either as the direct error or as the `underlying` error of a `GraphQLResultError`. Please check out the changes to [`FetchQueryTests` in PR #644](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/644/files#diff-43b7c3a7619bfcbf87cf3eabe314d908) for a better look at how some of that has changed.
- **BREAKING**: Updated the codegen to use v2.16 of the Apollo CLI. ([#647](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/issues/647)). This is a major version change so some things need to be added, and some parameter names have changed: 
  - You must add `--target=swift` so the CLI knows to generate Swift code.
  - If you were using `--schema=schema.json`, use `--localSchemaFile="schema.json"` instead (the quotes are required!).
  - If you were using `--queries="$(find . -name '*.graphql')"` to pass in an array of all your GraphQL files, use `--includes=./*.graphql` instead. 

  If you get error messages about multiple versions of node when you attempt to run, delete the `node_modules` folder in your source root and rebuild. 
  
  Upgrading fixes several issues:
  
  - `operationName` is now generated for all operations.
  - Trailing newlines are now added to all generated files. 
- **NEW**: Ability to upload files according to the [GraphQL Multi-part request spec](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec). ([#626](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/626), [#648](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/648), inspired by [#116](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/116))
- **NEW**: Now that `operationName` is generated for all operations, we're sending it along with all requests. ([#657](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/657), inspired by [#492](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/492))
- **NEW**: We're also sending `operationName` as the `X-APOLLO-OPERATION-NAME` header and when an `operationIdentifier` is provided, sending that as the `X-APOLLO-OPERATION-ID` header. ([#658](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/658))
- **NEW**: Option to run `VACUUM` on your SQLite store when clearing to help obliterate all traces of data. ([#652](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/652))
- **NEW**: Auto-generated API documentation from inline comments. Now available [on the website](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/api-reference/) NOTE: Any manual changes made to markdown files will get overwritten, if you want to contribute to the docs, please add inline comments to the code and then I'll get the docs updated. ([#642](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/642)). 
- Made `GraphQLResultError` and its underlying error `public` for better error handling. ([#655](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/655))



### v0.12.0
- **BREAKING**: Removed internal `Result` type in favor of Swift's built in `Result` type. This allows you to not have to prefix anything that uses the built-in result type with `Swift.Result` in places where you're using the Apollo SDK. ([#641](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/641))
- **BREAKING**: Set strict dependency versions for Starscream and SQLite.swift to prevent potential problems with Swift version conflicts. ([#641](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/625)). 
- **BREAKING**: Made Carthage dependencies for Starscream and SQLite.swift private so they're not automatically pulled in when trying to build just the main SDK with Carthage. If you're using the `ApolloSQLite` or `ApolloWebSocket` frameworks with Carthage, **please read the updated documentation!**. ([#635](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/635), [#641](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/641))
- Fixed issue where `GET` requests were requiring `AnyHashable` instead of `Any` which made requests with `Bool` properties never send. ([#628](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/628), big thanks to [#624](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/624))

### v0.11.1

- **NEW**: Added `.fetchIgnoringCacheCompletely` caching option, which  can result in significantly faster performance if you don't need the caching. ([#551](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/551))
- **NEW**: Added support for using `GET` for queries. ([#572](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/572), [#599](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/599), [#602](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/602))
- Updated lib and dependencies to use Swift 5, and say so in the Podfile. ([#522](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/522), [#528](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/528), [#561](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/561), [#592](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/592))
- Exposed a method to ping a WebSocket server to keep it alive. ([#422](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/422))
- Handling is always done on a handler queue. ([#539](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/539))
- Added documentation on the `read` and `update` operations for watching queries. ([#452](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/452))
- Updated build scripts for non-CocoaPods installations to account for spaces in project names or folders. ([#610](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/610))

### v0.10.1

- Disabled bitcode in Debug builds for physical devices ([#499](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/499))
- Don't embed the Swift standard libraries by default ([#501](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/501))

### v0.10.0

- Swift 5 support ([#427](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/427), [#475](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/475))
- Update to newest version of Starscream ([#466](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/466)
- Add ability to directly update cache with write methods ([#413](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/413))
- Add docs for `read` and `update` operations ([#452](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/452))

### v0.9.5

- Add ability to pass params to `Query.Data` ([#437](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/437))
- Provide separate archs for the iOS Simulator ([#410](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/410))
- Actually install the correct version of Node instead of just checking for it ([#434](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/434))


### v0.9.4

- Updated required version of `apollo-cli` to `1.9`. A nice addition to `1.9.2` is that Swift Enums now conforms to Hashable enabling among other things comparision between fetch objects. ([#578](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-cli/pull/578))
- Fixed internal bug that caused infinite reconnection cycle when connection is lost. A reconnectionInterval was added as a workaround. ([#368](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/368))
- Fixed internal bug that prevents the `wrongType` case being returned by the `JSONDecodingError` implementation of `Matchable`. ([#367](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/367))
- Added delegate for WebTransport which can handle connection/reconnection/disconnection events of websocket. ([#379](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/379))

### v0.9.1

- Since `apollo-codegen` is now part of the new [`apollo-cli`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-cli), the build script used to generate `API.swift` needs to be updated. See [the docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/installation.html#adding-build-step) for the updated script.

### v0.6.0

- Added read and write functions for fine-grained manual store updates.

- Added support for pluggable asynchronous caches, with an optional experimental SQLite implementation.

- Fragments are now merged into the parent result, so you only need to go through `fragments` when you want to pass a fragment explicitly.

- Generated result models are no longer immutable (but still obey value semantics).

- Generated result models now have memberwise initializers (when they represent a concrete type) or type-specific factory methods (when they represent multiple possible types).

- Any generated result model can be safely initialized from a JSON object (`init(jsonObject:)` and converted into a `jsonObject`.

- Generated input objects now differentiate between a property being `null` and a property not being present.
