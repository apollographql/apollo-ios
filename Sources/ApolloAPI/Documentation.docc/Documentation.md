# ``ApolloAPI``

The internal models shared by the [``Apollo``](/documentation/apollo) client and the models generated by [``ApolloCodegenLib``](/documentation/apollocodegenlib)

## Overview

This library allows you to use your generated models without importing the full [``Apollo``](/documentation/apollo) client. The generated models import ``ApolloAPI`` and expose the necessary functionality. For most use cases, *you should not need to import ``ApolloAPI`` into your code.*
