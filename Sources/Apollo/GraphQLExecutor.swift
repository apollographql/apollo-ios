This means we get a separate result for every fragment, even though all fields that share a response key are still executed at the same time for efficiency.

///     ...FriendsAppearsIn

/// fragment FriendsAppearsIn on Character {
///   friends {
///     appearsIn
///   }
/// }

/// 
/// A server would return a response with `name` and `appearsIn` merged into one object:
///
/// ```
/// ...
/// {
///   "name": "R2-D2",
///   "friends": [
///   {
///     "name": "Luke Skywalker",
///     "appearsIn": ["NEWHOPE", "EMPIRE", "JEDI"]
///   }
/// }
/// ...
/// ```
/// 
/// The executor on the other hand, will return a separate value for every selection:
///
/// - `String`
/// - `[HeroAndFriendsNames.Data.Hero.Friend]`
/// - `FriendsAppearsIn`
///   - `[FriendsAppearsIn.Friend]`
///
/// These values then get passed into a generated `GraphQLMappable` initializer, and this is how type safe results get built up.
